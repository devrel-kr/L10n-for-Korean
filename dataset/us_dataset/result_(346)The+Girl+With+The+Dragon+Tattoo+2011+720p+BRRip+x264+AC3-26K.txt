모르겠네
흰색이야 액자는?
어두운 색   우체국 소인은?
지난번과 같아 메모는 없고요?
그래 유감이군요, 헨리크 밀레니엄: 여자를 증오한 남자들 항소할 거예요?
기삿거리가 그렇게 없나?
중대한 사건이잖아요
뻥튀기하니 그렇지 한마디 해줘요
항소할 거예요?
그래, 자네한테 항소할게 블롬크비스트 씨는 범죄자에 맞선 용기 있는 언론인처럼 보였죠
다분히 악의적인 의도가 있었어요
폭로 기사는...    증거가 필수죠
언론 플레이를...    역효과 났죠
언론인에겐 치명타예요
명예훼손 소송에서 패소했습니다
저 샌드위치 줘요
블랙커피랑 블롬크비스트 씨는 올해 초 베네르스트룀 그룹 회장이 폴란드에 지원되는 산업차관을 유용 크로아티아 우익단체와 무기 거래를 했다고 폭로했습니다
개인적 감정은 없어요
언론인으로서 악의는 없었겠지만 잘못된 기사를 썼으니 책임을 묻는 겁니다
우리 일반인들처럼 기자들도 자신의 행동에 책임을 져야죠
손해배상액은 60만 크로나입니다
말보로 담배랑 라이터요
어디 갔었어?
좀 걸었지   담배 피웠어?
한 대 방송국 연락 왔는데 노코멘트라고 했어
그래, 다른 전화는?
전화통에 불났었어   고생했겠네
내 잘못도 있잖아
왜?   편집장이니까   그건 달라   끝난 거 아냐 난 끝났어 피곤해 집에 들어가서 일주일쯤 잘래
남편한테 못 들어간다 할게 고마워 언제 올지 몰라요
직접 통화하셨죠?
약속 개념 없는 친구라...
회사에서도 인기 없어요
프리랜서로 딱이죠
내가 만나잔다고 전했소?
고객 접촉은 원래 금지라   아끼는군요
물론이죠
기록 보셨듯 최고의 수사관이죠
근데?   마음에 드실지 모르겠군요
좀 달라요
어떤 점이?
모든 게요 왔습니다
리스베트 여긴 프로데 씨 반갑네
보고서에 문제 있어요?
아니, 전혀 빠뜨린 내용에 관심이 있어서   빠뜨린 거 없어요
자네 의견이 없던데   의무사항 아니에요
의견이 없다?
깨끗한 사람이에요
청결하단 뜻?
헛말을 안 해요
딱 기자 체질이죠
오늘 판결로 명성에 흠이 갔겠군 맞아요, 바보 된 거죠
재판 내용대로면...
함정에 빠졌다 생각하나?
그야 모르죠
자네 말처럼 바보가 된 건 틀림없지 금전적으로 그가 입은 타격은?
손해배상금 내면 알거지 될 거예요
가도 되죠?
잠깐만 모호한 부분 있던데 그의 사생활 일부러 빠뜨린 거라도?
중요한 건 없어요
빠뜨렸다는 뜻인가, 아닌가?
살란데르 양 말은 사생활은 지켜줘야 한단 겁니다
살란데르 양 주관과 달리 도덕적 결함 있는지 알아야겠소
동료 편집장과 오랜 연인 사이예요
그 때문에 이혼했고요 오럴섹스 하는데 자주는 아니고요
빠뜨리길 잘했군 알아요
방예르 산업 변호사 미카엘 블롬크비스트 새로운 메일 인터뷰 가능할까요?
베네르스트룀 위키피디아 베네르스트룀 방예르 산업 재무과 근무 동생분을 변호사로 썼어야죠   도와준댔는데...
거절했죠
그러길 바랐잖아
가족이라   싫다고   어차피 졌을 거야
베네르스트룀이 언론과 금융감독원에 경고를 던진 거야
아무것도 묻지 말란 거지 힘내 아빠 닐라, 내 걱정은 마   엄마가 걱정해   날?
아빠 재산 베네르스트룀 인터넷 허브 닐라?

아무것도 기도한 거야?
얘기하기 싫어 싫어하잖아
뭘?
닐라   삶의 빛 뭐?
블롬크비스트 씨?
네 성탄절에 미안해요
프로데라고 하는데 방예르 씨의 변호사죠
들어보셨죠?
물론이죠
사적인 일로 만나길 원하세요
지금은 상황이 좀 곤란한데 미안하군요
나도 저녁 들려던 참이오 그런 뜻 아니에요
재판 말이군요
우리한텐 즐거움을 줬죠
네?
방예르 씨도 베네르스트룀을 싫어해서   전화하라고 하세요
직접 만나길 원하세요
장소는 북부의   헤데스타드 섬    그건 힘들어요
스톡홀름까지 오시긴 연로하셔서 생각해봐요
그곳 겨울은 참 아름답죠
나중에 이 번호로 전화할게요
혼자 깨는 거 참 싫어   미안해   뭐 해?
보도자료 써   내용은?
자기가 발행인 맡고 난 이번 일 책임지고   회사 떠난다고   포기하는 거야?
물러나는 거지
정말 화난다   헤데스타드엔 처음?
또 마지막이죠
무슨 말씀을, 봄에 좋은데 겨울이 좋다고 하시더니 올해는 유난히 춥네요
4시 30분 기차로 돌아갈 거예요
폭설 내리면 못 가죠
농담이에요
원한다면 그렇게 해요
잘 왔네
들어오게 안은 따뜻해 안녕하세요?
그래 나에 대해 뭘 아나?
한땐 일류기업의 총수이셨죠
한땐 일류였지
그런 뜻 아닙니다
저도 있을까요?
아니 우리 할아버님이 철도를 놓으셨네
자네가 타고 갈 기차 철도 우리 방예르 가문이 오늘날의 스웨덴이 되게 일조했는데 지금은 주력제품이 뭔지 아나?
비료일세 오해 말게 회사엔 관심 없으니 내가 원하는 건 정의고 시간이 별로 없네
날 도와주게 뭘 말입니까?
공식적으론 내 자서전 집필 하지만 진짜 자네가 할 일은 기자 능력을 발휘해서 미스터리를 푸는 걸세 최근 일로 경황없겠지만 도둑, 깡패, 악당들을 조사하는 거지 세상에서 가장 추악한 집단의 사람들 내 가족일세 앉을래?
그럼 치워줄게   만들었어?
돈부터 줘 자원봉사도 아니고 이걸로는 어림없어 고맙단 말은 됐어 하리에트일세 우리 형 리샤르드의 친손녀지 형님은 나치 광신자였는데 17살에 극우단체에 가입했어 자유 민족사회 연맹 재미있지 않나?
나치들은 항상 자유를 내세우지 4시 30분 기차?
알아 형님은 1940년에 나치 위해 순교했는데 생전엔 가족을 등한시하고 아내 마르가레타와 아들 고트프리드를 걸핏하면 때렸지
고트프리드가 하리에트의 아버지야
다혈질이었군요
그래 여자, 술 좋아하고 영업에 타고나서 전국을 돌아다니며 고객들을 상대했지
그런 분들 있죠
그래 아무튼 걔는 1965년에 죽었네
술 취해 바다에 빠졌지
원래 자유분방한 아내 이사벨라는 남편이 죽고 더 방탕해졌고 그래서 내가 남매를 맡아 돌봤네
현 방예르 산업 대표인 마르틴과 네, 검색해봤어요
그리고 하리에트 걔는 총명하고 호기심 많고 미래가 밝은 아이였어 예뻤고요
잘못됐어요?
가족 누군가 걔를 살해하고 지난 40년 동안 날 미치게 만들려고 노력해왔네
1966년 9월 24일 토요일 하리에트는 16살이었고 그날 여기서 나와 형제들 가족이 모두 모여서 연례 주주 회의를 했지 시내에선 요트 클럽이 퍼레이드 했는데 친구들과 구경 갔던 하리에트가 2시 조금 넘어 돌아와선 내게 할 얘기가 있다더군
그때 뭘 하고 있었는진 기억 안 나지만 난 기다리라고 했지
근데 그 잠깐 사이에 사고가 났네
하리에트 일과 상관없으면서도 밀접한 사고 사고 현장은 아비규환이었어 경찰차, 구급차, 소방차...
기자, 사진사, 주민들이 죄다 몰려들었지 섬에 있던 우리도 다리로 달려갔고 운전사 이름이 아론손이었는데 차체에 몸이 끼었어 공구를 쓰면 불꽃이 일까 봐
맨손으로 그를 구하려 했지 한 시간쯤 지났고 하리에트는 주방에 있었어 안나도 걔를 봤지
마침내 아론손을 구해 병원으로 보내고 우리 가족은 하나둘씩 집으로 돌아갔네
사고 처리 끝났고 저녁 자리에 앉았는데 그 자리에 하리에트가 안 보이더군 다음 날 아침 그 다음 날에도... 그렇게 40년이 흘렀네
무슨 얘기였을까?
왜 내가 시간 내서 들어주지 않았지?
가출한 거 아닐까요?
그건 절대 아냐 소방관들이 밤새 기름 제거했는데 아무도 걔가 건너가는 걸 못 봤어 일요일이라 배들은 모두 정박해 있었고 내가 다 확인해봤네
익사 가능성은?
여긴 물살이 약해 물에 빠졌다면 시체가 떴겠지
그 애 아비도 빠진 곳에서 10미터도 못 가 발견됐었어
아니, 누군가 걔를 죽인 거야
그날 섬에 있었던 누군가가...
그 애가 내 생일에 뭘 선물했는지 아는 아주 가까운 사람이 그 애가 준 걸세 나머지는 범인이 보낸 거고 누가 알죠?
나, 경찰, 그리고 범인 이젠 자네도 알지 경찰 수사는 시들해졌지만 난 포기하지 않았네
그날 일을 조사하며 반평생을 보냈지 심정은 이해하지만 절 고용하시는 건 돈 낭비예요
아직 보수도 말 안 했잖아   그럴 필요 없죠
감사합니다
40년간 못 찾아내신 걸 제가 찾아내진 못해요
추적 기자로서 탁월한 능력 가졌잖아
제안하겠네
이 섬으로 오게 호숫가 방갈로를 내줄 테니 내가 보내는 자료를 검토 내가 놓친 걸 찾아주게 제 삶을 버리고...
휴가 온다 생각해 성가신 사람들 피해 머리 식히러 기간에 관계없이 지금 월급 2배를 주겠네
해결하면 4배 주고   방예르 씨 마저 듣게 한 가지 더 제안하지 자네가 간절히 원하지만 돈으로는 살 수 없는 것 그걸 주겠네
한스에리크 베네르스트룀 내 밑에서 일했던 친구라 관심을 갖고 재판을 지켜봐 왔지
자네 주장이 옳았네
입증을 못 했을 뿐이지 이런 상황에서 자서전 쓰겠다고?
날 해고했잖아
스스로 그만뒀지 북극 말고 내 곁에 있어줘
어떻게 비쳐질지 알잖아 도망가는 것처럼 보이겠지
베네르스트룀은 내가 백기 들기 바라 우리가 삐걱거리면 더 좋아하겠지
그는 회사가 망해야만 그만둘 사람이야
나 혼자 싸우라고?
기차로 4시간 거리야
북극이 아니라고 체스 챔피언   바비 피셔 저 왔어요
연결이 안 됐습니다
다시 걸어주십시오 연결이 안 됐습니다
다시 걸어주십시오
왜? 우유 줘?
연결이 안 됐습니다
다시 걸어주십시오
이것도 같이요
팔름그렌 씨 따님?
아뇨, 제 후견인이세요
말해줘요
뇌출혈이 있었는데 원인은 뇌진탕이나 뇌졸중이에요
혈압이 높은데 의식이 돌아올진 장담 못 해요
의식이 돌아온다 해도 뇌 손상은 불가피하고 군나르예요
관리인이죠
들어오세요
네   저기 두실래요?
네 작가시군요
방예르 씨 자서전 써요
TV에서 봤어요
유감이군요
유죄 받았지만   감옥 안 가 다행이죠
네 돈 많이 들었죠?
됐어요
우리 가족이 섬 전체를 소유하고 있네
가장 가까운 이웃이 내 형인 하랄드인데 역시 나치 신봉자야
가족 중에 둘이나... 형제지만 혐오스러운 사람이지 집에 박혀 지내니까 만날 일은 없을걸세   사건 당일 있었어요?
그래 형님 딸 세실리아가 저기 사는데 서로 말 안 해 친한 가족은 없어요?
하리에트의 엄마 이사벨라가 저기 사는데 형하고 친하게 지내
그래서 난 상종 않고 그렇군요
세실리아의 오빠인 비르예르는 저기 살고 그는 누구와 상종 않죠?
아마 자네 하랄드처럼 아주 성가신 인간이지
누가 누군지 헷갈리네요
곧 다행이란 생각 들걸세 우리 가족의 본색 알면 기겁할 테니까 저기가 마르틴 집일세 하리에트 오빠   누구랑 말을 하죠?
나 회사를 이끌고 있지 저녁감 사냥하는군 군나르겠지 만났어요
하리에트 사라졌을 때 19살이었어 집은 저기고   회장님은 저기 살죠
뭐?
회장님 집이요
그래 맞아 경찰에 신고한 사람이 유력한 용의자인 법이지 마르틴 방예르 산업 대표 헨리크 전직 방예르 산업 대표 사업상 정적?
퍼레이드 사고 다리 모렐 형사 신고 접수 밤 9시 45분 모렐 형사 현장 도착 밤 10시 19분 아이 어머니일세 어머닌 만취 상태 밤 10시 20분경 모렐 형사가 방을 조사 빗, 손수건 지갑, 수첩 모두 그대로 밤 10시 30분경 피해자 가족 조사 밤 11시 15분경 실종자 수색 허가 다음 날 아침 6시 40분 수색대 도착 시체 못 찾은 게 놀랄 일도 아니지 섬 전체를 팔 순 없으니 범행 동기도 못 찾았네
충동적 살인?
계획된 살인?
비밀을 알았던 걸까?
사업상 문제?
사업이요?
16살이었잖아요
아주 똑똑했어
장차 회사를 물려받을 유력한 후계자였지 그날 친구들과 퍼레이드 갔다던데?
몸이 안 좋다면서 먼저 갔대 친구들 말이 비밀이 많았다더군
10대 여자애들 종잡을 수 없잖아
저도 딸이 있죠
그럼 잘 알겠군 궁금한 게 있는데...
이거요
그 애가 그전 성탄절에 헨리크한테 받은 거야
수도 없이 살펴봤었어 달달 외울 정도로   마지막 페이지가...   알아 이름과 숫자들 무슨 의미가 있을 텐데 이 지역 전화번호였어 첫 번째 번호는 마르고트 엄마가 마그다였는데 하리에트를 모른다더군 네 번째 RL은 로즈마리 라르손 실종 사건 몇 년 전에 죽었지 나머지 번호들은 사건과 관련 없었네
기억하기 싫으셨을 텐데...
잊을 수가 있나 나의 '레베카 사건'인데 무슨 뜻이죠?
어떤 형사한테나 해결 못 한 사건이 있네
토르스텐손이란 고참이 있었는데 레베카 사건을 매년 조사했어 틈날 때마다 사건 파일을 뒤졌지
우린 그런 그를 비웃었고 그것도 소녀 실종 사건이었나요?
아니, 난 그저 경찰관의 '영혼'을 말하는 거야
그는 그 사건을 해결하지도 포기하지도 못했어 마그다 사라 팔름그렌 씨는 어때?
뇌졸중으로 쓰러졌다면서?
안됐네
보안업체에서 하는 일이 뭐야?
커피 타고 우편물 정리요 정직원 아니고 걸핏하면 결근하고 7, 8월엔 커피 안 타도 됐나 봐?
얼마나 벌어?
충분히요
집세는?
잘 내요 늦게 낸 적은?
없어요
눈썹 피어싱이 멋지다 생각해?
문제가 뭐냐면 팔름그렌 씨가 법적 후견인으로서 네 돈 관리를 제대로 안 했단 거야
안 한 게 아니라 날 믿고 맡긴 거죠
난 못 믿어   난 애가 아니에요
옛날엔 어땠고?
정신병원에서 지내면서 폭력적 성향을 계속 보였더군 위탁가정에 적응 못 했고 마약 복용으로 두 번 체포됐었고 남자 얼굴을 병으로 갈겨 체포된 건 최근 일이네 팔름그렌을 어떻게 구워삶았는진 몰라도 이걸 보면...
날 쳐다보는 네 눈빛을 봐도 그렇고 넌 안 변했어 좋은 시절 다 간 거지 앞으로는 매달 용돈 받아가고 어디다 썼는지 영수증 첨부해 돈이 비면 마약 했다 여길 거야
잘해왔어요
정부가 돌봐줬으니까 살란데르, 날 보라고 그동안 네가 한 짓 여기 다 적혀 있어 내가 이렇게 한다고 놀랄 사람 세상에 아무도 없어 다시 병원에 들어가고 싶어?
미카엘?
네   난 리브예요
안녕하세요
태워줄게요
고마워요
힘들게 언덕을 올라오시더라고   저질 체력이라서   누구라도 힘들죠   들어와요
고마워요
헨리크가 칭찬하더군요
마르틴, 냄새 참 좋다
뭐 마셔?
전망이 멋지네요
그룹 석유화학 계열사 근무했었는데 매각되면서 자릴 옮겼죠
그땐 힘들었어
지금은 홍콩 사는데 고향에 오면 마르틴과 며칠 같이 지내요
사슴 스테이크 때문이죠
맛이 기차잖아요
문이 열렸네
와인 괜찮소?
다른 걸로?
아뇨, 괜찮아요
책을 쓰신다죠?
헨리크 자서전이요
좋은 분이에요
마르틴도 그렇고요
스웨덴의 전형적인 신구 세대죠
그렇죠
하리에트 일 아시죠?
모르세요?
압니다 다 쉬쉬하지만 진실은 밝혀져야 돼요
뭐가?
하리에트 일 그 얘긴 나중에 하죠
아뇨, 지금 해요
리브도 우리 가족 다 알아요
그래서 나와 결혼 않는 거죠
이것도 이유고 책에 넣지 말아요
다른 건 괜찮소 하리에트 일도 그 일 이후 모든 게 변했소
가족뿐 아니라 회사도   어떻게요?
우린 스웨덴에서 가장 큰 가족 경영 회사요
한땐 직원이 4만 명이었지만 지금은 그 절반이오 하리에트 죽고 내리막길 탔죠
헨리크가 회사에 관심 잃었으니까 상처도 컸고   그날 섬에 있었죠?
4시 30분 기차로 왔소
유조차 사고 직후에   알아요
끔찍한 날이었죠
그 후로도... 결국 동생을 못 찾았고 더 끔찍해졌어요
자서전에 그 사건을 크게 다뤄줘요
복지부에서 연락 왔는데 다른 후견인 배정해주더군요
안녕하세요
네 인사나 할까 해서   세실리아예요
그러시군요, 들어오세요
커피?
아뇨, 괜찮아요
가족사에 대해 쓰는 걸 모두 불편해해요
헨리크와 회사에 대한 책인걸요 그게 그거죠
누굴 음해할 의도 전혀 없어요
소송당했던 기사와 다르다?
네, 완전히 다르죠
하리에트 사건 파헤치는 거 아니에요?
간과할 순 없지만 그게 핵심은 아니죠
군나르가 갖다 준 그 상자들은?
헨리크가 조사한 자료죠?
누가 더 미친 건지 모르겠네요
나치 아버지랑 집착하는 삼촌 말이 나왔으니 어떤 사람이었죠?
하리에트요
헨리크한테 들었잖아요
10대 소녀의 심리를 잘 모르셨겠죠
제가 제 딸을 모르듯이 부인과 동갑이었죠?
내 동생 아니타요 하리에트와 아주 가까웠죠
어디 계시죠?
아마, 런던이요
동생이 어디 있는지 몰라요?
오랫동안 못 봤어요
사이가 안 좋았었죠
가족 특징이네요
여기가 싫다며 런던으로 가버렸는데 놀러 오기는커녕 카드 한 장 안 보내요
제가 찾아보죠
혹시 찾으면 우리 얘기를 해줘요
욕을 먹어도 놀라지 말고요
백업해놨죠?
집에요 다행이네요
이건 이제 못 써요
성병 걸려봤어?
에이즈 검사는 언제 받아봤어?
지난달엔 몇 명이랑 잤지?
여자랑도 잤나?
필수 사항이라 묻는 거야
알아서 써요
왜 그렇게 비싼 컴퓨터가 필요해?
일에 필요해요
커피 타고 우편물 정리?
내 돈이니 상관 마요
그러려면 사람들과 잘 어울려야지 그럴 수 있어?
잘 어울릴 수 있는지 알아봐야겠군
나부터 시작해볼까?
주고받는 게 세상살이야 다 그렇게 살지 컴퓨터는 가져도 돼 만져봐 명품이야 지퍼 내려 이제... 이제...
망설이는 듯한 그 표정 그럴듯하네
아니타 방예르?
실례합니다
불쑥 찾아와 죄송해요
아뇨, 괜찮아요
앉으세요
감사합니다
미카엘입니다
안녕하세요
반갑습니다
투자 상담 받으시려고요?
그럴 돈이 없어서...
네? 그럼 용건이?
헨리크 방예르 씨의 자서전을 쓰고 있어요
20년 넘게 못 뵀어요
아뇨, 더 오래됐죠
언니나 가족과도 인연 끊고 살았고 고향 떠나시기 전 일을 물어보려고요
뭘 말하시는 건지...
60년대까진 대충 다 들었고 헨리크의 삶을 바꾼 사건 얘기를 해보죠
하리에트 그 형사한테 다 말했어요
이름은 모르겠고...
모렐 이젠 기억이 희미해요
제가 알고 싶은 건 사건보단 하리에트가 어떤 사람인가예요
아주 엉망이었어요
방예르 가문의 다른 애들처럼 방탕한 엄마 술꾼 아빠 나치는 아니었지만...   폭력을 썼어요?
우리 아버지요?
아뇨, 그녀 아버지 잘은 모르지만 이상한 구석이 많았어요
지나칠 정도로 말이 없다가도 때론 화장을 짙게 하고 딱 달라붙는 스웨터 입고 학교 가선 수녀처럼 성경을 공부했죠
종교를 믿는 집안이 아니었는데...
걔는 행복하질 않았어요
무슨 일을 당한 걸까요?
그야 뻔하죠
범행 동기나 의심 가는 사람은?
전 그냥 걔가 너무 불쌍했어요
난 18살 때 고향을 등졌는데 걔라도 그랬겠죠 18살이 못 돼 죽었지만... 리스베트 살란데르예요
잠시만요 오랜만이네, 잘 지냈어?
못 가서 죄송해요
일 때문에 바빠서 무슨 문제라도?
아뇨, 전혀요
급하게 돈이 필요한데 밤에 사무실로 갈까요?
퇴근하고 없을 테니 우리 집으로 와 펜 있어?
외울게요, 주소 불러요
네?
저예요
리스베트 들어와   맘에 들어?
좋네요
이런 게 집이지 돈은 왜 필요해?
식비요
어떻게 지냈어?
집에서 만나니까 좋네
돈이나 줘요
그래도 될지 보자고 잠깐만 문제 있어?
물어볼 게 있어요
식비 필요할 때마다 이래야 돼요?
화내니까 귀엽네
나도 물어볼게 뒤로 하는 거 좋아해?
믿음은 바라는 것의 실상이요 보지 못하는 것의 증거이다 믿음으로 모든 세계가 하나님 말씀으로 지어져...
태워다 줄게
됐어요
정말? 1만 크로나 리스베트 살란데르 식비   집 안은 따뜻해?
아니 미카엘이 없어서 금전적으로 회사가 어렵다면 사과하리다   잘 해결될 거예요   그래요?
얼마나 버틸 수 있죠?
한 6개월?
대충 그쯤이요
나도 50년대에   언론사 6개를 소유했었소
지금도 하나 있죠
헤데스타드 신보    못난 조카가 경영해요
우리가 투자하면?
전에는 생각도 안 해본 일이죠
독립성을 추구해서 언론의 독립성은 광고에 의존하죠
편집의 독립성은 최대한 보장하겠소
잠깐만 무슨 얘기를 하는 거죠?
투자를 논하는 걸세   그건 아는데, 왜요?
돈 때문이 아니에요
회사가 최악인 상황에 미카엘을 빼내 왔으니 도덕적으로 옳은 일이라 생각되는군요
또 다른 이유는... 뭐죠?
내 친구의 적은 곧 나의 적이요
언제부터 논의했어?
어제 전화해선 오라더라고   왜 말 안 했어?
숲에 살잖아
지금 날 바보 취급해?
조건 들어보려고 자긴 거절했을 테고 좋은 생각 아냐 6개월 버틴다
는 거 거짓말이었어 투자 안 받으면 끽해야 3개월이야 방예르 가문 사람들 정상이 아냐
누가 결혼한대?
투자 받으면 휘둘리게 돼
그럼 거절해 회사가 망하든 말든 뒷짐이나 지고 있자   미카엘   왜? 나, 아침에 떠나   근데?   안 잘 거야?
그 문신총 얼마예요?
한 3천쯤 꽤 아플 거야
시작할게 방예르 산업이 자금난을 겪는 '밀레니엄'사의 경영권을 인수했습니다
'밀레니엄'은 현재 굉장히 저평가돼 있어 투자 가치가 높아요
또 난 악당을 싫어하지요
베네르스트룀 씨 말인가요?
법을 들이대며 적을 굴복시키려는 자들이요
베네르스트룀이 다시 고소하면 우리 방예르 산업을 상대해야 될 거요
방예르 씨를 존경해요
신사시죠
하지만 연세가 드셔서 거짓말쟁이 농간에 넘어가신 거 같군요
320이요
발신: 베네르스트룀 제목: 방예르/블롬크비스트 이 자식들이 무슨 꿍꿍이지?
젠장 아니타 하리에트 아니타 헤데스타드 신보 최근 자료는 CD에 담겼고 오래된 자료는 필름이에요
찾으시는 시기가?
1966년 9월 고맙소 하리에트 사건?
그 사건 알기엔 젊으신데 어렸을 때 그 사건 예로 들며 낯선 사람 조심하라 배웠거든요
리스베트   집세 내야 돼요
돈 줘요
들어와 저번엔 그렇게 가서 마음이 안 좋았어
나도 다행이네, 살아 있어서 이 가방 기억나?
저번에 들고 왔었어
이거?
버튼이 아냐 광섬유 광각렌즈지 오럴 시킬 줄 알았었어
그것도 역겨운데... 네가 변태인 걸 깜박했던 거지
너도 한번 당해봐
잘 들어 날 봐 다시 앉을 수 있을 때...
좀 걸리겠지만 은행 가서 계좌를 내 이름으로 바꿔 끄덕여 그리곤 다신 내게 연락 마 매달 나와 만났다는 가짜 보고서 만들어 내가 아주 잘 지내고 사교적이 됐다고...
그리고 법원 설득해서 내 지위를 원상복귀해 안 그럼 동영상을 인터넷에 올릴 거야
끄덕여 만약 내가 교통사고 당하거나 잘못되면 자동으로 인터넷에 떠 알았으면 끄덕여 명품이네 집 열쇠 가져갈 거야
확인하러 올 테니까 불시에 들이닥쳤는데 여자랑 있으면 동영상으로 안 끝나 죽여버릴 거야
빈말 같아?
내 정신 감정 보고서 봤지?
의사들이 뭐랬지?
한마디로?
내가 미쳤대
아냐, 사실이니까 끄덕여도 돼
나, 진짜 미쳤어 끄덕여!
내 말대로 하는 게 어려울 거야
특히 여자를 멀리하는 거 그래서 도와줄까 해 가만있어!
처음 해보거든
피도 많이 날 거야
난 악질 강간범이다
어쩐 일이야?
셀레프테오 가는데 시간 별로 없어 거긴 왜? 성경 캠프 그래 나, 광신도 아냐 괜찮아, 닐라 뭐든 너만 좋으면 돼 의지가 된다면...
신만 아님 된다?
그런 말 아냐 그동안 아빠가 네게 너무 소홀했어 미안하다 그래도 내가 싫어할까 봐
속마음 숨기고 그러지 마 안 그래 내가 만나러 가야 했는데   미안해   괜찮아 아빠 봐서 좋았어 갈게   또 보자   응 고마워 가톨릭 너무 미워하지 마
뭐?
아빠 기사 가톨릭 기사 쓰는 거 아냐 성경 구절 보이길래 (사랑해) 레위기 영매나 접신한 여잔 돌에 맞아 죽으리라 여호와께 드리는 선물이 비둘기면 제사장은 비둘기의 머릴 비틀고 날개를 꺾고 제단에서 불사르라   네?
모렐 형사님, 미카엘입니다
잘 지냈나?
아직 그 섬에 있나?
말씀하신 레베카 사건 성 기억하세요?
물론, 근데 왜?   관련 없겠지만...   레베카 야콥손 어떻게 살해됐죠?
참수됐네
팔이 잘리고 불태워졌지 40년대에 벌어진 사건이야
뭘 알아냈나?
다시 걸게요
왜?   헨리크예요?
대화 중에 갑자기 쓰러졌소
괜찮을까요?
나도 모르겠어요
일단 어서 가요 안녕하세요 어떠세요?
생명에 지장은 없지만 경과를 봐야죠
중환자실에 있소
네   주겠소?
샌드위치요?
스카치   네 고맙소
헨리크가 일을 맡기면서 제게 약속하신 게 있어요
정보를 준댔죠
베네르스트룀?
혹시라도... 돌아가실까 봐?
좀 지나치군요
죄송해요
어떤 정보 가졌는지 난 몰라요
물어볼 상황도 아니고...
혹시나 잘못되시면 누구한테 보고하죠?
나한테 해요 파봐야 나올 게 없지만...   아뇨, 그야 모르죠
무슨 뜻이오?
실마리를 찾았어요
설마... 뭘 알아냈소?
지난번엔 확신 없이 기사 썼다가 전 재산을 잃었죠
조수 필요한데 허가 좀? 물론 생각해둔 사람이라도?
찾아봐야죠
유능한 사람 있소 선생 뒷조사했던...
뭐라고요?
우리가 배경 조사 없이 아무나 고용했겠소?
보여줘요
내 뒷조사 보고서 다 봤어요
이게 그 여자 이름이죠?
여기저기 뒤져도 기록이 전무하던데   이름이 중요합니까?
만나봐야겠소
규정에 어긋나요   그래요?
기자도 정보원 보호하잖소 좋아요
이 이름 주인 내 동생이자 변호사인데 연락할 거요
불법으로 수집한 정보 많더군요
그녀 기록이 없는 건 법원 명령 때문이에요
정부가 관리하죠
그래서요?
힘들게 살아온 친구인데 그냥 조용히 넘어갈 수 없겠소?
누구세요?
미카엘 블롬크비스트   지금은 곤란한데...
들어가도 돼?
부탁해 반갑군, 얘기 좀 하자고 아침을... 이런, 친구 있었군
당신 뭐예요?
자네가 뒷조사해서 낱낱이 파헤친 사람 옷 입고 친구는 보내 할 얘기 있어 미안, 가줘야겠어
그래 같이 있어줄까?
아니   잘 가   네 갈게   미안해   괜찮아 불쑥 찾아와 놀랐나 보군 날 건드리면 가만 안 둬요
그럴 일 없어 내 뒷조사 제대로 했더군   기분은 나쁘지만...   그렇겠죠
난 인물 기사 쓸 땐 우호적이야
베네르스트룀은 달랐죠
회사 대표 말이 관심 가진 임무만 맡는다고?
내게 관심 가져줘
고맙군 좀 앉아 또 민감한 사안은 전부 자네한테 맡긴대 그렇게 말했어 "민감한 사안" 근데 컴퓨터 해킹하는 건 민감한 게 아니라 불법이야 고소할 순 있지만 안 그러겠어
내 얘기를 들어보고 구미 당기면 내 조사를 도와줘 싫다면 설거지하고 영원히 꺼져줄게
이거, 먹어 무슨 조사요?
리스베트...
이름 불러도 돼?
여자들을 죽인 범인 잡게 도와줘 RJ는 레베카 야콥손 나머진 누군지 모르지만 16살 소녀의 죽음과 연관돼 있어 이들이 누군지와 성경 구절들의 의미를 알아내야 돼
어디 가?
일 시작해요
계속 떠드시든가   안 읽어봐?
다 외웠어요
강간, 참수, 토막 살인 불, 제단, 성직자, 창녀 미해결 마리, 마그다 온라인 경찰 보고서 없음
나비야!
어떻게 들어왔어?
마그다란 이름 40년 만에 들어봐
추천장 밀턴 시큐리티 젊은 아가씨가 그 살인사건은 왜?   관심 생겨서요   그래?
아내가 살해되면 대개 남편이 가장 유력한 용의자인데 그 사건은 달랐어 이웃도 노숙자도 아니었고 용의자를 특정 못 하고 우왕좌왕하다 보면 사건 해결은 물건너가지 어떻게 살해됐죠?
이름이?
살란데르 살란데르 양 밥 언제 먹었어?
살 안 찌는 체질이에요
그런 뜻 아냐 먹은 지 얼마 안 됐으면 토할지 모르거든 여호와께 양을 바치려거든 흠 없는 암컷이어야 한다
그 제물 머리에 안수하고 회막 문에서 잡아 제단에 피를 뿌리면 죄를 용서받으리라   좀 어떠세요?
수술에 필요한 동의서를 직계 가족이 작성해야 하는데 결정 못 하고 저러고 있으니...
살란데르 양은?
승낙했어요
뵐 수 있을까요?
아깐 주무셨는데 다시 확인해보죠
감사해요
짐 싸서 떠나라고 해요
어머니, 그만 하세요
어따 대들어?
헨리크가 고용한 분입니다
투표로 정하죠
바보 같은 소리 헨리크가 원하는 일이에요
목숨이 위태로운데 이런 스트레스 도움 안 돼 죄송하지만 여긴 금연이에요
스톡홀름으로 돌아가요
명예훼손 고소당한 사람이 우리 가족사를 쓰는 건 싫으니까 알았어, 고마워 이쪽이에요
여자가 짐승과 동침하면 여자와 짐승 둘 다 죽여야 하느니 피로 죄를 씻게 하라 비르예르 방예르 하랄드의 아들 우리 가족은 구제불능이오
그래서 회사가 엉망이 됐죠
어머니 행동은 사과하겠소 익숙해졌어요
헨리크와 나쁜 감정이 있어서 그래요
아버지 돌아가시고 술만 드셔서...
헨리크한테 나랑 동생을 빼앗겼소 쫓겨나다시피 해서 외롭게 살았고 아직 앙금이 남았죠
여기 남아요
선생은 헨리크의 마지막 희망이니까 결말을 봐야죠
어머닌 내게 맡기고 하지만, 서둘러요 물론이죠
리스베트   이리 줘   괜찮아요
마르틴 방예르 씨   안녕하시오?
네   여자친구?
조수예요
고맙소
굿나잇 잘 찾아왔네?
주민들이 다 알던걸요 어련할까, 샌드위치 줄까?
아뇨 나도 바이크 탔었어 알아요
하리에트 리스트의 살인사건 5건 유사한 5건 중 3건은 확실해요
레베카가 첫 피해자였고 두 번째는 창녀인 마리 홀름베리 1954년, 성경 구절처럼 살해됐어요
그래 "월경 중에 동침한 여인은" "자기 피의 근원을" "드러냈음이다" 강간, 폭행당했고 직접 사인은 생리대로 인한 질식 라켈 룬데, 1957년 청소부이자 점쟁이인데 빨랫줄에 목이 졸렸고 머리가 돌에 짓이겨졌죠
레위기 20장 27절 "영매나 접신한 여잔" "돌에 맞아 죽으리라"   밖에서 피우지?
사라 비트, 1964년 목사 딸인데 침대에 묶였죠
범인은 강간 후 집을 불태웠어요
레위기 21장 9절 "제사장의 딸이 매음하면 아버지를" "속되게 함이니 그녀를 불사를지니라" 마그다 로비사, 1960년 헛간에서 강간 후 살해 옆에 있던 소의 목을 갈라서 피를 시체에 뿌렸어요
레위기 20장 16절 "여자가 짐승과 교합하면" "같이 죽이되 서로의 피를 묻혀라" 레아 페르손, 1962년 애완동물 가게에서 강간 후 살해 범인은 동물들을 다 풀어줬고 피해자 성기에 잉꼬 넣었어요
에바 구스타프손, 1960년 가출 소녀, 목 졸라 살해 목에 불탄 비둘기를 묶어놨죠
레나 안데르손, 1967년 학생, 강간 후 목을 잘라...
됐어   안 끝났어요
연쇄 살인범과 섬에 사는 소녀가 어떤 연관이 있는 거지?
그녀도 범인을 찾았어요
강간, 고문, 불 짐승, 종교   빠뜨린 거 있나?
피해자들 이름 성서에 나와요
첫 희생자 창녀는 성모와 이름이 같았고 레베카, 사라는 구약에 등장하죠
그럼 모두 유대인이군 방예르 가문 사람들은 유대인을 싫어해 저기 사는 사람도 난 소파에서 잘게요
알았어
그래 참, 고양이 튀어나와도 놀라지 마   굿나잇   잘 자요 하리에트의 이름은 아니에요
뭐가?
유대인   아니지
뭐 해?
당신 메모 읽어요
암호 걸어놨는데 풀었어요, 커피 마셔요
그래 이번엔 그냥 넘어가지만 앞으론 멋대로 손대지 마 퍼레이드 사진으로 많은 걸 알아냈네요
고마워   이 여자 사진은 없지만   누구?
이 여자요
잠깐 좀... 그래 이건 닫고 이게 아냐 그래, 이거 이게 도대체 어디지?
그래, 이거랑 이거...
그리고... 뭐라고 쓰였지?
N...
R S J   노르스조 마을 그리고 K...
R I F "목공" 목수를 찾아야겠군
빌어먹을!
이 지역에서 일했던 목수라면 여기서 장비를 구입했을 거예요
누군지 모르겠어요
혹시 아실까 했어요
1966년에 찍은 사진이면 양로원으로 가봐요 브란룬드 아들이야
어디 가면 만날 수 있죠?
시립 공동묘지 오래전에 공사장에서 사고로 죽었어 아내는 아직 살아 있을 거야
어디 사는지 아세요?
1966년에 남편분과 헤데스타드 섬에 가셨죠?
누가 찍은 거죠?
동네 사진사요 부인이 찍은 사진들 아직 갖고 계시면 좀 볼 수 있을까요?
신혼여행 사진이라 다 있어요
근데 왜요?
이 아가씨, 확대한 사진이... 이게 부인이고 길 건너를 보고 있는데 사진 찍힌 직후 살해됐죠
끔찍해라   여기요
감사합니다
카피해도 될까요?
네 대표님 허락 없인 이 장비들 못 내줘 전화해보든가 다음엔 정식으로 신청서 작성해와 누굴 본 걸까?
내려가요
요즘 성생활 어때?
지난 보고서 맘에 안 들어 대충 쓴 티가 팍팍 나 다음 달 보고서는 성의껏 써 아가리 닥치고 고개만 끄덕여 정신과 의사 매수해서 내가 아무 이상 없다고 증언하게 해
그리고 문신 제거하면 또 새길 거야
여기다   치실이야?
네 바늘 소독할 거지?
반창고 붙이면 안 돼?
안 돼요
뭐라고?
고마워, 젠장!
마셔요
그래 눈 조심해   움직이지 마요
의사 아니잖아   젖은 옷 벗어요
뭐?
고마워 피가 멈춘 거 같아 아직도 더럽게 아프지만 다 미쳤어 다 제정신이 아니라고 괜찮아, 괜찮아 더럽게 아프네, 염병할 완전히 미친 사람들이야 날 노리고 쐈어 사고가 아냐
지금은 안 쏘죠
좋은 생각 아냐
왜요?
난 늙었고 동료인데다...
편집장하고도 자잖아요?
나도 양심이란 게 있어 말 그만 해요
젠장 창문 열까요?
당신과 일하는 게 좋아요
나도 그래   오발 사고겠죠   군나르가 노렸다면 못 살았을 거요
밀렵꾼일지 모르지 움직이면 무조건 쏘니 미카엘 말이 옳다면?
중단해야 돼요
그만두고 싶소?
경찰 기록, 사진 조사 자료 다 입수했고 방예르 회사 기록을 봐야겠어요
왜요?
열람 허가해줘요
회사 기록을?
언제 것부터?
헨리크가 뭐든지 다 지원한댔어요
회사 기록은 아니오   비밀보장 각서에 서명이라도 하죠
잠시만 헨리크라면 허락할 거예요
내겐 그분을 지켜 드릴 책임이 있네
숨길 게 뭐죠?
120년이나 된 회사잖아
숨길 게 많지 진실을 원한다면 열람하게 해줘요
뭘 찾죠?
방예르 산업과 피해자들 살해 장소와의 연관성 프로데에 대한 모든 것도 하랄드 그날 부인 아버지가 찍은 사진을   봤으면 하는데   직접 물어봐요
대신 좀?   알다시피 말 안 해요
이번만 예외를?
우리 아버지 만나는 게 겁나요?
안 도와줄 거예요?
미안해요
부탁해요
끝났어요?
1949~1966년까지 공장 위치 알아야겠어요
다 드렸잖아요
아뇨 자회사, 협력사 하청업체 자료는 없어요
그건 못 드려요
프로데 씨가   다 볼 수 있댔어요
이 층에만 국한됐죠
전화해보시든가 만나주셔서 감사합니다
들어와   차?
네 스벤 올로프 린드홀름 그리고 나 핸섬하시네요
비르예르 푸루가르드 그리고 나 페르 엔그다흘 정치와 상관없는 사진에 관심 있다고?
친구나 친지들 사진이요
찾아봐 이름이 뭐랬지?
블롬, 블룸?
블롬크비스트 난 누가 오는 걸 막은 적 없어 지들이 안 오는 거지
이 사진들 치우시면...
그들처럼 과거를 숨겨라?
내 본질을 짜맞추라고?
조립식 가구처럼?
난 누구보다 정직해   가족 중에서요?
스웨덴에서 풍경 사진?
경치 좋아?
누구죠?
희미해서 잘 모르겠는데 고트프리드 아들이야
마르틴?
인물만 훤칠하지 아비처럼 쓰레기야
아버지를 닮았군요
퇴근 시간이에요
아직 멀었어요
야근은 금지라...
난 괜찮아요
잠긴 문 열 수 있게 열쇠는 놓고 가요 전화해보시든가 경비한테 맡겨요
고마워요
카를렌과 방예르 항구를 다시 열다 점쟁이 겸 청소부 카를렌 건설 악수하는 카를렌과 고트프리드 방예르 고트프리드 방예르 그룹 칼손 화물 인수 우데발라 방예르 그룹 투자 레아 페르손 시체로 발견 고트프리드 방예르 젠장!
추모 고트프리드 방예르 레나 안데르손 1967년 웁살라?
마르틴?
미카엘 안녕하세요
산책 나왔어요?
네   어떠세요?
좋아요
병원에 들렀는데 헨리크가 물어보라더군요
뭘요?
들어와요, 한잔합시다
마르틴 방예르 (맨 오른쪽) 웁살라에서 학업 중 안녕, 마르틴 문 닫아요, 바람이 세요
어떻게 된 거요?
언제요?
방금 전에 넘어졌어요
날이 어두워서 손전등 없어요?
하나 주죠
부주의해서 넘어진 거죠
수사는 어때요?
새로울 게 없어요   그래요?
그 아가씨 아주 영리하다던데 뭔가 찾아내겠죠
어쩌면요
고마워요
뭐죠?
네?
헨리크가 내게 물어보랬다는 거   금방 물어봤잖소   뭘요?
수사 상황 그걸 물어보랬죠
사냥해요?
언제 같이 갑시다 그러죠
전혀 없어요?
보고할 만한 게?
전혀요
안절부절못하네요
아뇨 집에 가고 싶어서?
조금요 애인과 저녁이라도?
조수예요
총이 훨씬 낫지
네?
사냥 가서 칼보단 총이 훨씬 낫죠
보여줄 게 있소 술 가져와요
칼은 놔두고 오른쪽으로 메시지 남기세요
사람 쏘는 것보다 더 힘든 거?
일부러 못 맞히는 거야
실패했군, 내가 멀쩡하니 제대로 쐈기 때문에 살아 있는 거야
들어가 술 쏟았잖아
그냥 가지 그랬어?
가도 돼?
어떻게 알았지?
뭘 알아냈어?
말 안 해?
그럼 그냥 죽여줄까?
사진을 찾았지
아무도 못 본 사진   누구 사진?
당신 웁살라 학교 교복 입은...
그게 뭐?
당신이 거짓말한 증거지
그래?
그날 알리바이 거짓말은 누구나 해 레나 안데르손과 동창이었고 레나 참 오래됐지
그 사진 어디 있어?
네놈 책상 위에?
내 노트북에 복사해놨어
그래?
보안 웹사이트에   웃기는군 거짓말 마 그 여자는 얼마나 알지?
네놈만큼 알아야 죽이는 재미가 있는데 지금 어디 있어?
스톡홀름, 아침에 갔어
또 거짓말 회사에서 옛날 기록 뒤져보고 있어 회사 직원이 전화했더군 리스베트란 여자가 성가시게 한다면서 이름이 맘에 들어 리스베트 리스베트가 출발하면 보안팀이 전화할 테니 당신 방갈로에서 맞아줘야지
덕분에 그 여자까지 잡게 됐어 알고 싶은 게 뭐야?
기자잖아, 물어보라고 여자들 처리 방법?
좋은 질문이야 죽이기 전에 편하게 앉아서 술을 한잔해 아주 즐겁지
내가 곧 죽일 여자와 가벼운 수다 해치운 후엔 먼바다에 던져버렸어 아버지처럼 아무 데나 버리는 건 바보 같은 짓이지 아버지는 여잘 밝혔어
사실, 죽어도 싸지 그런 짓 하면서 술독에 빠져 살았으니까 살인엔 규율이 필요해 섬세한 작업이거든 계획하고 실행하고...
뒷마무리가 제일 중요해 왠지 알겠지?
사방에 피가 튀거든
하나 물어볼게 왜 사람들은 본능을 안 믿지?
뭔가 잘못된 걸 알면서도 무시하잖아
네놈도 낌새 차렸지만 들어왔잖아
내가 끌고 들어왔어?
아니 난 그저 술 한잔 권했을 뿐이라고 호의 거절하는 게 고통이나 죽음보다 더 끔찍하진 않을 텐데 다 제 발로 들어와선 당신처럼 거기 앉아 죽길 기다렸지 끝까지 희망 갖는 사람들도 많더군 "잘 설득하면 돼" "기분 안 상하게" "울거나 빌면 살려줄 거야"
지금 당신처럼 그들 얼굴에서 희망이 사라지는 걸 보면 내 아랫도리가 단단해져 우린 다르지 않아 둘 다 욕구가 넘치지
다만, 내 욕구는 청소가 좀 필요할 뿐이야 재미있는 거 말해줄까?
네놈이 나, 리브와 사슴고기 먹고 있을 때...
리브는 내가 지극히 평범한 줄 알지 이리나가 여기 있었어 이리나가 누구냐고?
헤픈 계집이야 외국에서 온 창녀   누가 신경 써?
동생은 아니었지
뭐?
하리에트는 그런 여자가 아니었어 그 애를 찾았어?
어떻게 된 거였지?
당신이 죽였잖아
형사 흉내나 내는 쓸모없는 자식 말을 못 하겠어?
잘됐네, 대화가 지겨워졌거든
남자는 처음이야 건드려본 적 없어 아버지만 빼고 우리 의무였지 하리에트와 나의... TV 위에 총 있어   죽여도 돼요?
그래 왜 23살짜리 성인이 법원 관리를 받는 거지?
정신병자로 등록돼 있거든요
언제부터?
12살부터 무슨 짓 했길래?
미안해, 괜한 걸 물었군 아빠를 죽이려 했어요
산 채로 불태워서...
한 80%만 죽였죠
커피 끓였어요
누구야?
하리에트요
마르틴 집 지하실에서 찾았죠
다른 여자들 죽인 걸 부정 안 했는데 하리에트 얘기를 하니 혼란스러워했어 사건 전모를 모른다고 내게 화를 냈고 그가 안 죽였어
그의 아버지도 아니고 한 해 전에 죽었으니까 그녀가 스스로 섬에서 도망친 거라면?
도망쳤고 아직 살아 있다면 행방을 알 사람은 딱 한 사람뿐이야
아니타 방예르 떴다, 떴다
당신 차례예요
그래 여기 안녕하세요
귀찮게 해서 죄송해요
왜 오셨죠?
연락 못 받았어요?
무슨?
오촌 마르틴이요
그가 왜요?
자동차 사고로 죽어서 장례식이 열릴 거예요
난 관심 없어요
이해해요
뭘요?
가족에 대해 아무 애정 없다는 거   그래도 알아야죠   알았으니 됐죠?
어땠어요?
잘된 거 같아 접속했어 인터넷 쇼핑하네
저 구식 게임을 해?
전화한 데 없어?
네 핸드폰도 도청돼?
하리에트 행방 알 줄 알았는데 손 다시 넣어요
하리에트한테 전화 안 한 이유?
단 하나죠, 죽은 사람이니까 내 생각엔...
잠깐만 이제 말해요
다른 시나리오도 가능해
네, 그러죠
또 뭐죠?
오빠가 죽기 전에 날 죽이려 했어요
하리에트 당신이 꽃을 보냈군요
그래요 아니타가 결혼한 기록을 찾았는데   가족들은 몰랐죠?
네 아니타는 결혼 후 이름 바꿔 런던으로 왔고 당신은 그녀 이름 썼군요
아뇨, 그 반대였어요
내가 자기 남편과 있어야 안전하다 생각했죠
남편 반대는?
전혀요
아니타를 사랑했으니까 자기를 사랑한다면 이유를 묻지 말랬고 그는 묵묵히 따라줬죠
둘 다 20년 전에 죽었고?
차 사고로... 그것도 알아냈군요
당신이에요?
14살 때 처음 강간당했어요
마르틴?
아뇨, 아버지요
마르틴이 날 강간한 건 아버지가 죽은 후였고   왜 숨겼죠?
엄마한텐 말했어요
헨리크한텐...
말하고 싶었지만 내 잘못이 탄로 날까 무서웠어요
무슨...
아직 모르는군요
처음 강간당하고 1년 내내 계속 당했는데 하루는 아버지가 평소보다 더 취해선 자기가 죽인 여자들 얘기를 자랑삼아 늘어놨어요
내 옷을 찢으면서 성경 구절을 외고 목에 벨트를 감더니 날 죽이려 했죠
간신히 도망쳐서 선착장으로 갔는데 아버지가 비틀대며 쫓아왔어요
좁은 공간에선 저항 못 했지만 넓은 야외에선 술주정뱅이 하나쯤 제압할 수 있었죠
다 끝나고 위쪽을 보니 마르틴이 보고 있더군요
지옥에서 벗어났는데 다른 지옥에 빠진 거죠
두 달 후 마르틴은 웁살라 학교로 갔고 난 마침내 악몽이 끝났다고 생각했어요
근데 그날 퍼레이드 구경하는데 길 건너편에 있더군요
그때 알았죠
영원히 안 끝날 거란 걸 어떻게 도망쳤죠?
아니타가 소지품을 전부 다 놔두고 가랬어요
하나라도 없어지면 가출로 의심받는다고 모두가 저녁을 먹을 때 난 숨어 있었어요
그날 밤 수색 작업이 시작됐죠
아침에 아니타가 날 데리러 왔어요
그 다리는 나와 집을 잇는 끈이었는데 가족한테서 도망칠 수만 있다면 경찰만 통과하면 안전할 거라고 생각했어요
안전했죠
당신이 나타나기 전까진...
이제 안전해요
어떻게 도망쳤어요?
나도 구해준 사람이 있죠
좀 어떠세요?
좋네 고마워, 안나 약속은 약속이니까 결과에 관계없이 지켜야겠지
베네르스트룀 그래, 뭘 알아냈나?
누구지?
안녕하세요
난 베네르스트룀이 근무한 게 기억 안 나요
그렇겠죠, 오래전 일이니까 회사 공금을 횡령해서 자기 회사를 차렸어요
공소시효 지났어요
이런 기록 있는지도 몰랐고 알았다면 당신을 고용하게 안 했소 속이려던 게 아니오 35년이 지나 고소 못 할 걸   헨리크도 알고 있었어요
명예를 중시하는 분이시니까 당신이 베네르스트룀을 무너뜨리길   바라신 거요
요즘은 악당이   영웅시되는 세상이죠
옛날 분이시니...
이걸론 베네르스트룀을 못 건드려요   털끝 하나도!
그렇겠죠
왜 베네르스트룀한테 당한 거죠?
내가 멍청했어
누가 정보 줬는데 나중에 알고 보니 그자의 하수인이었어 거짓 정보인 게 재판에서 밝혀졌지 해킹이 불법이고 비도덕적이라 했는데 베네르스트룀 경우라면?
말해봐
개인적으로 좀 알아봤었는데 이제서야 살펴봤죠
하리에트 사건으로 졸라게 바빴으니까 근데, 중요한 걸 건졌어요
중요한 걸 건져?
어쩌면요
러시아 범죄 단체의 자금을 세탁하는데 단 5%만 국내에 남기고 나머진 해외 계좌로 빼돌려   어떻게 알았어?
이번엔 묻지 마 말해 그의 컴퓨터를 들여다봤어
그의 회계사와 변호사도   어떻게? 내부자 통해서   거짓말 마   그렇게 알고 있어 내게도 숨겨?
정말 알고 싶다면...
알아야겠어
어떻게 한 거야?

범죄 행위를 폭로했습니다
어떻게 될까요?
사적인 복수심으로 몰아가겠지만 경찰과 금융위원회가 혐의 밝혀내면 감옥에 갈 거야 그럴까요?
아니 거물들은 항상 빠져나가지 금융계의 마피아?
베네르스트룀 사기 혐의 왜 그래?
좀 창피한데   말해봐
돈 좀 빌려줘요

그 언론인이란 작자가 주장하는 내용은 터무니없어요
그를 다시 법정에서 만나길 기대하죠
그가 제출한 서류는요?
다 날조됐어요
하지만 금융 당국의 생각은 사뭇 다릅니다
극히 일부라도 사실로 밝혀지면 증권거래법 위반은 물론 범죄 행위를 조사할 겁니다
정보의 출처를 파악하는 게 급선무예요
출처라면?    베네르스트룀 측근이죠
회사의 실세만이 접근할 수 있는 민감한 정보니까요
베네르스트룀 씨 변호사인 내게 물어봐요

아버지 선물?
친구요
좋아하는 친구군요   늦었어   괜찮아   What kind is it?
I don't know.
White?
And the frame?
Dark.
Postmark?
Same as last time.
And no note.
No. I'm so sorry, Henrik.
Will you appeal?
What is this?
The media event of the year?
Don't try to play it down, Mikael.
It won't work.
Don't try to play it up.
That won't work either.
Mikael, can we get a quote?
Mikael, will you appeal?
Yes.
I'll appeal to you, Viggo.
Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist was able to play the victim... ...
the brave journalist going up against the bad guy.
I don't know why malicious intent couldn't be proven.
When you call a guy a criminal...
If you want to say these things...
Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity.
There's really no greater disgrace for a journalist than libel. ...
Was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel.
Can I get that sandwich there?
And a black coffee.
In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed... ...
Wennerström, founder and president of the Wennerström Group... ...
used state funds intended for industrial development in Poland... ...
in an arms deal with the right wing Ustaše in Croatia.
I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist.
He's a fine journalist... ...
who I don't believe is guided by malice.
But what he wrote was inaccurate.
And inaccuracies can't go unanswered.
All journalists have to accept, like the rest of us... ...
actions have consequences.
Blomkvist was ordered to pay... ...
600,000 Swedish kronor in damages and all court costs.
Can I get a packet of Marlboro Red and a lighter?
Yeah.
Where have you been?
Walking.
Thinking.
Smoking?
Yeah.
Just one.
TV4 called.
I told them no statement... ...
until we've read the judgment in its entirety.
Well, I have.
Anyone else?
Everyone who wants to see you humiliated.
Been on the phone all morning?
I'm as much to blame.
You are?
You wrote it?
I read it.
I ran it.
Not the same.
Our credibility isn't dead yet.
Mine is.
I'm tired.
I'm gonna go home, crawl under the duvet for a week.
I'll call Greger, tell him I'm not coming home.
Thank you.
It's possible we could wait forever.
You called her and spoke to her?
I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.
No one here particularly likes her.
I find it's much better if she works from home.
But you told her I wanted to meet with her.
I've told her many times I prefer her not to meet clients.
You like her?
Very much.
She's one of the best investigators I have, as you saw from her report.
But?
I'm concerned you won't like her.
She's different.
In what way?
In every way.
Miss Salander is here.
Lisbeth.
Mr. Dirch Frode.
How do you do?
Something wrong with the report?
No, it was quite thorough.
But I'm also interested in what's not in it.
There's nothing not in it.
Your opinion of him isn't.   I'm not paid to give my opinion.
So you don't have one?
He's clean, in my opinion.
You mean he's hygienic?
He's who he presents himself to be.
In his business, that's an asset.
Well, there's less in his asset column after his conviction today.
True.
He made a fool of himself.
If it happened that way.
Are you suggesting that he was set up?
That was never part of my assignment.
But you're right.
He did make a fool of himself professionally.
How much of a fool did he make of himself financially?
The judgment will just about empty his savings.
May I go?
Moment.
Your report is light in another area.
His personal life.
Anything you chose not to disclose?
Nothing that warranted inclusion.
Does that mean yes or no?
I think what Miss Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right... ...
to a certain amount of privacy, even if they're being investigated.
Not in this case.
I need to know anything about him... ...
I might find unsavory, even if she doesn't. He's had a longstanding sexual relationship... ...
with his co editor of the magazine.
It wrecked his marriage but not hers.
Sometimes he performs cunnilingus.
Not often enough, in my opinion.
No, you're right not to include that.
I know.
You needed a better attorney.
You needed your sister.
She offered.
He declined.
As she hoped.
Never a good idea.
Mixing family and business.
I would've lost anyway.
It wasn't about Mikael.
it was about Wennerström sending a message... ...
to the press and the FSA, saying, "Don't ask questions." Cheer up.
Dad.
Nilla, you don't have to worry about me.
Mom's worried.
About me?
About the money.
Good evening.
Nilla?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Are you serious?
I don't wanna talk about it since I know you won't approve.
Of...?
Nilla.
Light of Life.
Light of what?
Hello?
Herr Blomkvist.
Yeah.
Forgive me for intruding on Christmas.
My name is Dirch Frode.
I'm an attorney.
I represent Henrik Vanger.
Perhaps you've heard of him?
Yeah, of course I have.
He'd love to talk to you about a private matter.
This is an awkward moment.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm about to sit down to a Christmas dinner myself.
No, that's not exactly what I meant.
You're referring to your recent legal problems.
That has provided us with much amusement.
I'm sorry?
Herr Vanger has little love for Herr Wennerström either.
Have him call me.
But he would love to speak to you... ...
in person, if possible.
Up north.
In Hedestad.
That's not gonna be possible.
Herr Blomkvist, he's far too old to go to Stockholm.
Please.
Be so kind as to consider.
Hedestad is lovely in the winter.
I'll call you back on this number.
Okay?
Usually when I wake up in a cold bed it's at home.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
I'm writing a press release.
Saying?
You're taking over as publisher, you're very sorry... ...
for any nuisance Mr. Wennerström was caused... ...
and I can't be reached for comment.
Are you giving up?
Stepping aside.
This makes me sick.
First time in Hedestad?
And the last.
Oh, don't say that.
It's lovely in the spring.
You said it would be lovely in the winter.
Well, this is unseasonable.
Well, I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
Unless we get snowed in.
I'm joking.
You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish.
Welcome.
Come inside.
It's warm.
How do you do?
So... ...
what do you know about me?
You used to run one of the largest industrial firms in the country.
"Used to." That's correct.
Oh, I didn't mean that.
Should I stay?
No. My grandfather forged the tracks... ...
that the 4:30 train will take you home on.
We stitched this country together.
We made the steel, milled the lumber that built modern Sweden.
And what do you think our most profitable product now is?
Fertilizer.
I'm not obsessed by the declining health of the company.
But I am with the settling of accounts.
And the clock is ticking.
I need your help.
I'm... Doing what?
Officially, assisting with my memoirs.
But what you'll really be doing... ...
is solving a mystery by doing what you do so well.
Your recent legal mishap notwithstanding.
You will be investigating thieves, misers, bullies... ...
the most detestable collection of people that you will ever meet.
My family.
Would you like to sit?
I could possibly clear a place if necessary.
Did you make it?
Have you something for me?
I am on welfare, I do not administer it.
This is not enough.
No, thank you.
This is Harriet.
The granddaughter of my brother Richard.
Richard was a Nazi of the first order... ...
joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17. Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word "freedom"?
Oh, the 4:30. Yes, I know.
Okay.
Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940. Missed all the real excitement.
But not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife, Margareta... ...
and their son, Gottfried.
Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father... ...
was what they used to call a good time Charlie.
They still call them that.
Do they?
Okay.
He was a charmer, a ladies' man and a drunk. In other words, a born salesman. Which he did for the company... ...traveling around and taking clients out to dinner.   Well, somebody's gotta do it.   That's right. Anyway, he died in 1965. Drowned, drunk, here on the island. His wife, Isabella, who had been pretty much useless as a parent before... ...became even more so after his death... ...which is when I began looking after the children. Martin, who runs Vanger industries, now that I'm retired. That's right, I Googled him. And Harriet. She was bright, curious... ...a winning combination in any person.   And beautiful.   Yeah. Something happened to her? Someone in the family murdered Harriet... ...and for the past 40 years... ...has been trying to drive me insane. It was September 24th, 1966. A Saturday. Harriet was 16. My brothers... ...and their wives and their children and grandchildren... ...were all gathered here... ...for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner. It was also the day the yacht club held their autumn parade. Harriet, with one or two school friends, went into town to see it. She returned a little after 2:00. She came into the parlor. She asked if she could talk to me. I honestly don't remember what I was doing... ...that I thought was more important... ...but I told her to give me a few minutes. It was during those few minutes that something else occurred. The accident had nothing to do with Harriet... ...and yet everything. It was chaos as everybody put down what they were doing. Police, ambulance, fire brigade... ...reporters, photographers, onlookers all quickly arrived from town... ...just as we on the island, the family, hurried to the bridge from our side. The driver of the car... ...a man named Aronsson... ...was pinned and severely injured. We tried desperately to pry him loose with our hands... ...since metal tools might spark. It was an hour after the crash that Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna herself saw her. Well, we finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital. Just as we from our side... ...slowly drifted back to the house. The sun was down, the excitement over. We sat down to dinner. It was then that I noticed... ...Harriet wasn't there. And she wasn't there the next morning. Or the next. Or the next 40 years. What was she going to tell me? Why didn't I make time for her? Why didn't I listen?   And she couldn't have just run away?   No. Not without being seen. The firemen stayed out all night... ...on the bridge pumping up gasoline. No one swam across or took a boat. All the boats were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, I checked. She couldn't have just fallen and drowned? No. The currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls in the water turns up. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than 10 meters... ...when he drowned the year before. Oh, no. Someone killed her. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know... ...what she used to give me each year on my birthday. Those are from her. And the rest, from her killer. Who knows about these? There's me, the police, the killer... ...and now you. After the police investigation evaporated... ...I kept at it, studying all the information there was. I have spent half my life examining the events of a single day. I understand your frustration... ...but what you're asking me to do, it's a waste of money.   But we haven't discussed your fee.   We don't need to. Thank you. I can't find something you've been unable to find in 40 years. You don't know that. You have a very keen investigative mind. Here's what I propose: You come stay on the island. I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. You study the material I send you. You find something I've missed or you don't. What you're asking me to do is set aside my life and career for... Think of this as a well deserved holiday. A way of avoiding all those people that you might want to avoid right now. As for compensation, I'll pay you double your salary... ...for as many months as it takes.   Quadruple it if you solve the mystery.   Herr Vanger... I'm not done. I will throw in one more thing... ...even though you're a terrible negotiator. It's something you want more than anything else... ...and it can't be bought at any price. So let me give it to you. Hans Erik Wennerström. He began his career working for me... ...and I have followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since. You were right about him. You just couldn't prove it. We're in the middle of the worst crisis ever, and you're writing a memoir.   You fired me. I need something to do.   You fired you. I need you here, not the North Pole. Mikael, you know what this is going to look like. Like I've been gutted. I'm running away. I am. Wennerström wants to see me wave a white flag, not a red flag. If it looks like there's a problem between us, it'll satisfy him. There is a problem between us. He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down.   You're leaving me to fight him alone.   Lt's four hours by train. It's not the North Pole. Hey, hey. Network busy. Please try again later. What? Some milk? Network busy. Please try again later. Oh, yeah. These as well.   You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?   His ward. He doesn't have a daughter. Please. He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging... ...either from the fall itself or from a stroke that led to the fall. His blood pressure is still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured. And it's possible, even if he does... ...that there will be neurological damage. Oh, jeez. Hi. I'm Gunnar. The caretaker.   Oh, hey, Gunnar. Come in.   Okay.   You want to put it in there?   Okay. You're an author. Well, I'm doing a biography of Herr Vanger.   I saw you on television.   That's unfortunate. Bit of trouble, I guess.   No jail time though. That's good.   No. Cost you a lot of money though, yeah? There. The entire island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald... ...another Nazi, if you can believe. Two in the family. Oh, yes, he's quite detestable, to put it nicely. But you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse.   He was there that day?   Indeed, he was. His daughter, Cecilia, lives over there. They don't speak. Does anybody speak to anybody on this island? Actually, Isabella, Harriet's mother, who lives there... ...she speaks to Harald, which is one of the reasons I don't speak to her. Right. Cecilia's brother, Birger, lives over there. Who doesn't he speak to? You, probably. But you wouldn't want him to. He can be just as unpleasant as Harald. Quickly losing track of who's who here. How you'll wish it were always so. Soon you will know us all only too well. With my apologies. Now, out there, my grandnephew Martin's house, Harriet's brother.   Who speaks to him?   I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you. Someone's shooting his dinner. Gunnar, probably. Oh, yes, I met him earlier. He was 19 when Harriet disappeared. Well, he lives over there.   And you live there.   Sorry? Your house. Oh, yes. Yes, you're right. The man who hires the detective... ...should always be kept on the suspects list. Her mother. But what about the search? Please. Please. I beg you. The fact that I never found a body was not surprising. You can't dig up an entire island. But neither could I find the motive. Was it spontaneous? Was it calculated? Did she know something someone wished she didn't?   Was it about business?   Business? Well, she was 16. And very bright. Henrik told me and many others he could easily see her... ...running the company one day. She was with some friends that day at a parade. She told them she was feeling unwell. She left early. But they also told me she kept secrets from them too. The main thing I learned was that teenage girls are complicated.   I have one.   Then you know. I wanted to... ...ask you about this. She received that from Henrik the Christmas before. I've studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it.   It's the last page I was curious about.   As was I. It's a list of names, numbers and it must have some significance. All local phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman, Margot... ...whose mother was Magda, who denied knowing Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosmarie Larsson... ...an elderly woman who died some years before. The other three were not connected in any way that I could find. I reminded you of things you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry. I can't forget. It's my Rebecka case. I don't know what that is. Every policeman has at least one unsolved case to obsess over. Back then we had an Officer Torstensson. Year after year, he kept going back to this Rebecka case. Taking out the files, studying them over and over. We were young. We laughed at him. And that was also a missing girl case? No, no, no, that's not why I mention it. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor old Torstensson never solved it. And he never let it go. So how's Mr. Palmgren doing? I heard he had a stroke of some kind? It's terrible. Now, what exactly do you do at this security company? Make coffee, sort mail. But not full time. Not even part time consistently. They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August?   How much do you make there?   Enough. How much is your rent? I pay my rent. And when was the last time you were late? Never. You think that thing through your eyebrow makes you attractive? Here's the problem. There's a discrepancy between the obligation... ...of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances. There's no discrepancy. it was clear I could manage my own finances. That is not clear to me.   I'm not a child.   You are not. But you were. And between then and now, you were committed... ...to the locked ward of St. Stefan's where you continued... ...to display violent aggression. And you failed to adapt to four foster homes... ...were arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics... ...again for assault, smashing a bottle into a man's face. And it's not even that long ago. You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking that you have changed... ...but when I'm looking at this... ...not to mention the way you're looking at me now... ...I don't think you have. So the good old Mr. Palmgren days are over. Starting now, you will be given a monthly allowance. You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses. If the numbers don't balance, I assume the difference is going to drugs. I've taken care of myself since I was 10. The state has taken care of you. Miss Salander, please, look at me, this is important. Since your behavior is elaborately documented in here... ...it will shock no one if I chose an alternative... ...to the very lenient arrangement I have just outlined. Would you prefer institutionalization?   Mikael?   Yes.   I'm Liv.   Oh, hi. We're going to the same place. Hop in. Oh, good, thank you. I found him at death's door, halfway up the hill.   I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape.   Lt's a climb for anyone.   I should've warned you. Come in.   Thank you, Martin. Henrik says great things about you.   No, no. Leave your shoes on.   Martin? Smells wonderful.   What are we drinking?   What a place. Look at that view. I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Göteborg. When it was sold, I went with it. A dark day. I live in Hong Kong, but come back to Stockholm for family events. And I drive up to spend a couple of days with Martin.   It's just the moose steak she wants.   Who can blame her? it's wonderful. Something's left open. Do you like this wine... ...or you want to try something else?   No, no, it's fine. You're writing a book now, Martin said.   Henrik's biography.   I love Henrik. He's fascinating. Martin too. Together they are the old Sweden and the new. Yes, they are. You know about Harriet, right?   You don't?   Yes, I do. The family doesn't want to talk about it, but it can't be swept under the rug.   What can't?   Harriet. We can talk about it later. We can talk about it now. Liv knows everything about my crazy family.   That's why she'll never marry me.   That's one reason. I don't want to read about that in the book. Everything else is fine. Harriet certainly. You know, everything changed after that. Not just the family but the company as well.   How so?   We're not Ericsson or Nordea. But we're still the largest family owned company in the country. At our height we had 40,000 employees. We have half of that now. And that downward slide began after my sister's death. It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit... ...and his heart.   You were here that day?   I came in later... ...after the accident on the bridge, with the 4:30 train.   I know it well.   A terrible day. And the days after, you know? Searching, not finding. Even worse. This event, Mikael, it has to have a big part in your book. I got a call from social welfare. I've been assigned a new guardian.   Hi.   Hello. I thought I'd come over and say hello.   I'm Cecilia.   Oh, yes. Please, come in. Can I get you some coffee? No, thank you. We are all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family. It's not about the family. It's about Henrik and the company. Like I said. It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone. Unlike the one that landed you in court. Unlike that one, yes. So you're not really here to find out what happened to Harriet. I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but, no, that's by no means my focus. Those boxes that Gunnar carted down here... ...which are where, in the closet now? Those weren't Henrik's investigation? I wonder sometimes who's crazier, my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle. Since we're talking about her... ...since you brought her up, what was she like? What was Harriet like?   I'm sure Henrik has told you.   He was my age back then. He couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager. You were the same age. My sister Anita was closer to her in age. She knew Harriet better than anyone. You should talk to her.   I'd love to. Where is she?   If I had to guess, London. You don't know where your sister lives? I haven't seen her in years. We never really got along.   I'm getting used to that comment.   She hates this place more than I do. She left. Moved to London, that was it. You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit. I'll track her down for you. If you do, and try talking to her about us... ...don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off. You're backed up, aren't you? Hard drive at home, yeah. Okay. That's good, because this one's done. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted diseases? And when was the last time that you were tested for HIV? How many partners have you had in the last month? And how many of those were men? It's regulation, I have to ask these things. it's a health matter. Write what you want. And why do you need such an expensive computer?   For work.   Making coffee, sorting mail.   I should have control of my money.   And you will. Once you learn to be sociable, get along with people. Can you do that? Why don't we start with that now, huh? Why don't we start with me? You do something for me, I do something for you. That's what normal people do. I want you to have that computer. Feel that. That's gabardine. Unzip it. And... I like the reticence. It's almost convincing. Anita Vanger.   Through there.   Thank you. Excuse me. I probably should have made an appointment. No, it's fine.   Please have a seat.   Thank you.   Mikael.   Mikael. How do you do? How do you do? So you're looking for investment counseling? Well, I would be if I had any money. I'm sorry, I don't understand. I'm writing a biography of your Uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here. I haven't seen him in over 20 years. Actually it's a lot more than that. Haven't seen my sister, haven't seen anyone in that family. Most of what I'm writing about predates that... ...so your recollections are valid. I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question. Well, then let me narrow it down. I've gotten up to the 1960s... ...to the event that, you know, changed everything in Henrik's life. Harriet. Everything that I know about that I told to whatever his name was. Merell. My recollections were a lot better then. I'm not really speaking about the event itself. I just want to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. She was very messed up. Well, just like all us Vanger kids, really, but... Crazy mother. Drunken father. At least her father wasn't a Nazi.   Was he abusive?   Mine? No, hers. Not that I ever saw, but you could tell that something was going on. Some days she'd be very withdrawn. And then the next minute she'd be putting on makeup... ...and wearing the tightest sweater that she had to school. And then she'd be studying her Bible like a nun. No Vanger was ever religious. Can you imagine? She was obviously very unhappy.   What do you think happened to her?   Everyone knows what. You don't have any thoughts about who or why? All that I know is that I felt really sorry for her. I got away when I was 18 and I never went back. And she'd have done the same. But she never made it to 18. Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth Salander. Hold for a moment, please. Lisbeth, I haven't seen you. Are you well? I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our appointment, I had a lot of work. Something the matter? No, no, nothing to be concerned about. Actually, I need another advance on my allowance. Can I come to your office tonight? I don't work at night, Lisbeth. Why don't you come to my house, huh? Do you have a pen? I don't need a pen. What's the address? Lt's...   Hello?   Lt's me. Lisbeth. Come on in.   You like it?   Lt's nice. It's home. What do you need money for this time? Food. How are you? I'm so glad you decided to come and visit. I just want my money. Well, let's see if we can help you out with that. Wait. Is there a problem? I just want to know... ...am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat? You're so cute when you're surly. I forgot to ask you: You like anal sex? Faith is the assurance of things hoped for... ...the evidence of things not seen. Through faith we understand... ...that the world was created by the word of God.   I'll drive you home.   I can get home on my own. Are you sure?   Is it any warmer inside?   No. I apologize if you've been having financial problems... ...at the magazine during Mikael's absence.   We'll work through them.   Are you sure? How long do you think you can hang on? Six months? That sounds about right. I used to be in the newspaper business.   We owned six dailies back in the '50s.   We still own one.   The Courier, here in town.   Which I let my nephew, Birger, run... ...because he can't run anything else. So, what would you say to taking on a partner? Well, we've never had to consider it before. We value our independence very much. Independence in publishing is dependent on advertisers. However much you have, you retain. We don't care about content. Excuse me? Did I miss something? Talking about investing in the magazine.   I gathered that. But why?   Not out of greed, that's for sure. I feel badly that I've taken Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. But now I am convinced that this is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason. And... And...? The enemies of my friends are my enemies. How long have you been discussing this with them? I haven't. They called yesterday and asked me to come up.   Why didn't you tell me?   You live in the woods.   I deserve to be treated like an idiot?   I wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could. Well, I'm saying it now. It's a bad idea. You heard me tell them we had six months. I lied. We will be out of business in three. But you don't know this family like I do. They're crazy. We're not marrying into it. If we do this, that's exactly what we're doing. So you wanna say no, let's say no. Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing.   Mikael?   What? I'm leaving this godforsaken island in the morning.   So?   So are you coming to bed or not? How much do one of those cost? Around 3000. This is really gonna hurt. Your call. Vanger Industries took a controlling interest in Millennium magazine... ...which, according to analysts, has been in financial trouble... Millennium is an excellent magazine. We think it's undervalued right now. Which is good business for us. Well, there's another reason. I don't like bullies. Are you referring to Mr. Wennerström? I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue his enemies into submission. If Herr Wennerström would like to try it again... ...he will find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back. I've always admired Henrik Vanger. He's a titan and a gentleman. But he's also quite old now... ...which may explain how he could be taken in by a convicted liar. Three twenty. Shit. The current archive is on CDs. The older stuff, still negatives. What general period are you interested in? September, 1966. Thank you. Ls this about Harriet Vanger? You're too young to know about that. Everyone here grows up knowing about her. It's how we're taught about strangers.   Lisbeth.   I need to pay my rent. I need some money. Oh, come on in. I feel a bit badly how we left it last time. Me too. Good. You're alive. You recognize this? I had it with me last time. I set it here, remember? And this snap, you see it? It's not a snap. It's a wide angle fiber optics lens. I thought it was going to be another blow job... ...which is disgusting enough. But I misjudged just how sick you are. Okay. Here's what's going to happen. Pay attention. Look at me. Once you can sit again... ...which could be a while, I admit, we're going to go to my bank... ...and tell them that I alone have access to my money. Nod. After that you will never contact me again. Each month you will prepare a report of a meeting we will never have. In it, you'll describe how well I'm doing. How "sociable" I'm becoming. Then you will negotiate with the court... ...to have my declaration of incompetence lifted. If you fail, this video will spread across the internet like a virus. Nod. And if anything should happen to me, if I get run over by a car... ...if you run me over with a car, this will upload automatically. Nod that you understand. Gabardine. I'm taking the keys to this apartment because I'll be checking on you. If I find a girl in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not... No, not the video. I'll kill you. Do you doubt anything I've said? Do you doubt what's in the reports that have followed me around all my life? What do they say? If you had to sum it up. They say I'm insane. No, it's okay, you can nod because it's true. I am insane. Nod! I know it's going to be hard for you to abide by my rules. The abstinence part most of all. So I'm going to make it easier for you. Lie still. I've never done this before. And there will be blood.   Hi.   Hi. What are you doing here? On my way to Skellefteå. I can only stay a couple of hours. What's in Skellefteå? Bible camp. Oh, yeah. I'm not dangerous. It's fine, Nilla. Whatever you want to do is fine. Everybody needs something. Just as long as it's not God. I didn't say that. I haven't been around enough to really know what's going on with you. And I apologize for that. But I'd never want you not to tell me something... ...because you think I might not want to hear it. That's what I'm doing. It should've been me visiting you.   I'm sorry.   Lt's okay. It was nice seeing you. Bye bye.   I'll see you.   Yeah. Thanks. Oh, don't go too hard on the Catholics.   The what?   The article you're writing. Oh, I'm not writing an article about Catholics. The Bible quotes by your desk. I love you. A woman who is a medium or a sorcerer... ...shall be put to death by stoning. If a dove is the sinner's offering... ...the priest shall wring off its head, cleave its wings... ...and burn it upon the altar.   Hello?   Detective Merell, it's Mikael Blomkvist. Yes, hello. How are you? Not still freezing in Hedestad, I hope, for your sake. You know that Rebecka case you mentioned. Would you recall her last name? Of course I do. But what has that to do with anything?   Nothing, probably.   Jacobsson. Rebecka Jacobsson. And how was she killed? She was decapitated. Her arms were cut off and she was burned. But all that happened in the 1940s.   What have you found?   I have to call you back. Why...?   Is it Henrik?   We were talking. He rubbed his arm, then he collapsed.   Think he's gonna be okay?   I honestly don't know.   You go. Talk to you later.   I'm sorry. Evening. So how is he? Well, the good news is he survived. How he does now, we'll have to see.   He's in intensive care.   Right.   May I have one of those?   You want a sandwich?   Small Scotch.   Sure. Thank you. I hate to be indelicate, but Henrik promised me something... ...when I agreed to do this.   Wennerström. I need to know what he has on him. Now. In case... In case he dies?   Well, that is indelicate.   And I apologize. I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me. And he can't tell you in the condition he's in, so... We also didn't discuss who I'd report to if something should happen to him. Oh, well, you'd report to me, of course. But we both know that nothing's going to come of this, don't we?   No. No, we don't know that.   What do you mean?   I may have found something.   You're joking. What have you found? The last time I reported on something without being absolutely sure... ...I lost my life savings. I need a research assistant. Can you authorize that? Yes. Do you have one in mind?   I can find someone.   I know an excellent one. She did the background check on you. The what? Well, you don't think we can hire just anyone... ...without doing a background check. I want to read that. Herr Frode was kind enough to share your report with me. The investigator's name. That is her name, yes? See, I can't find any record of her, and I'm pretty good at that.   Would it matter what her name is?   If I wanted to speak to her, yes.   It's against policy.   You sure? Just like your sources. You understand. Okay. Here's a name for you. My sister. She's also my lawyer. She'll be contacting you. There are things in here that can only have come from one place. The reason you can find no record of her is because her records are sealed.   She's a ward of the state.   What's that gotta do with anything? She's had a rough life. Can we please not make it any rougher? Who is it? It's Mikael Blomkvist.   Actually, I'm not really up yet.   May I come in? Please? Hi. You and I need to talk. I've got us some breakf... I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had some company. Who do you think you are? I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do. Why don't you put some clothes on, get rid of your girlfriend. We need to talk. I'm sorry, you have to go. Okay. Do you need me to stay? No.   Bye.   Bye. Bye.   Sorry.   Lt's okay. I guess I must have alarmed you, turning up like that. If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you. That won't be necessary. Your report, very detailed.   But for me, it wasn't very entertaining.   Lt wasn't meant to be. When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader. Wennerström wasn't entertained much. Your boss, Armansky... ...yeah, he tells me you only do jobs that interest you... ...so I suppose I should be flattered. You gonna sit down? He also says that you're the one he goes to when the job is sensitive. That's the word he used, "sensitive." I'm gonna use "illegal"... ...because that's what it was when you hacked into my computer. No, I'm not gonna do anything about that. I could, but I won't. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tell you a story... ...and if it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research further. And if not, I'll do the washing up and you'll never see me again. Here, you should eat that. What kind of research? Lisbeth... Oh, can I call you Lisbeth? I want you to help me catch a killer of women. I've got R.J. Rebecka Jacobsson. I've got absolutely no idea... ...who the rest of these are or how they're connected... ...to the death of a 16 year old girl, but they must be somehow. What we've gotta do is find out who they are, what happened to them... ...and what these Leviticus verses have to do with anything.   What are you doing?   Getting started.   You can keep talking if you want.   Don't you need to look over these? I got it. Cat! How'd you get in? No one has asked me about Magda in over 40 years. Why would a lady like you want to know about an awful murder?   It interests me.   Does it? Her husband was the first suspect. The husband is always the first suspect and usually the last. But not this time. We moved on to a neighbor. Then a vagrant. Once you get to strangers, it's only a matter of time... ...before you get to gypsies and you know you're never going to solve it. How exactly was she killed?   Miss...?   Salander. Miss Salander. I hope you don't mind me asking, but when did you last eat? I have a high metabolism. I can't put on weight. I'm asking because it is better to look at what I am about to show you... ...on an empty stomach. If a man's offering is a lamb, it shall be a female without blemish. He should lay his hand upon its head... ...slaughter it, empty its blood on the base of the altar... ...and he shall be forgiven.   How is he?   He needs surgery... ...but there's no DNR in place. So it's up to the family to decide... ...should the occasion arise, whether to resuscitate or not. And they're not good at decisions. So how was it with Miss Salander? She said yes. Do you think I might be able to see him? He was asleep the last time I looked, but let me check.   Thank you.   Don't check. Tell him to pack his things and leave.   Mother, please.   Don't use that tone with me. Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik.   We should put this to a vote.   Don't be an idiot, Birger. We all know what Henrik wants. Can we just do that? Henrik is fighting for his life in there. This is the last thing he needs. Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, there is no smoking in here. Go back to Stockholm. When we need a family chronicle written by a libelist... ...we know who to call. All right. Thanks. This way, miss. If a woman approaches any beast... ...and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast. Their blood shall be upon them. My family's impossible. That's why the company's such a mess. I apologize for my mother's behavior. I'm used to it. It has nothing to do with you. It's between her and Henrik. She lost it when my father died, and her drinking and her... Got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her... ...and left her excommunicated in the old house... ...on the other side of the island. She hasn't forgiven him. You must stay. You're the last chance Henrik has at some kind of resolution. Put this to rest one way or another. I'll keep my mother away. But please, hurry. Of course. Lisbeth.   I'll get that.   Lt's okay.   Martin Vanger.   How do you do? Fine.   It's a girlfriend, or...?   Assistant. Thank you so much.   Good night.   Good night. Problems finding the place? Everyone in town knows who and where you are. That's comforting. Are you hungry? I can make you a sandwich. No. I used to have a motorbike, a Triumph. I know. The five cases from Harriet's list. And five more she missed. Three I'm sure of. Rebecka was the first, just as you thought. The second, M.H., is Mari Holmberg, a prostitute in Kalmar... ...murdered in 1954, matching Leviticus 20:18. Right. "if a man lies with a woman having her sickness... ...he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered... ...the fountain of her blood." Raped and stabbed, but cause of death was suffocation by sanitary napkin.   Okay.   R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957. A cleaning woman and part time palm reader. Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped. Head crushed with a rock. Leviticus 20:27. "A woman who is a medium or sorceress... ...shall be put to death by stoning."   I usually like to smoke outside.   Sara Witt, 1964. Daughter of a pastor. Tied to her bed. Raped. Charred in the fire that burned down her house. Leviticus 21:9. "The daughter of a priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot... ...profanes her father and shall be burned with fire." Magda Lovisa Sjöberg, 1960. Found in a barn. Stabbed and raped with farm tools. The cow in the next stall had its throat slit. Its blood was splashed on her and hers on it. Leviticus 20:16. "If a woman lies with any beast... ...you shall kill the woman and the beast. Their blood is upon them." Lea Persson, 1962. Found by her sister in their pet shop. Raped, beaten. The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums. There was a parakeet inside her. Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960. A runaway. Raped, strangled. A burnt pigeon tied around her neck. Lena Andersson, 1967. A student. Raped, stabbed, decapitated...   Okay.   I'm not finished. We're looking for a serial murderer... ...but what could that have to do with a teenager living on an island? She was looking for him too. Rape. Torture. Fire. Animals. Religion.   Am I missing anything?   The names. They're all Biblical. The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary. Rebecka, Sara, all from the Old Testament. Which means they're all Jewish. One thing the Vangers have more than their fair share of, it's anti Semites. There's one right there. I can sleep on a couch. Okay. Right. Oh, yeah, there might be a cat somewhere.   Good night.   Night. Harriet's name isn't. Isn't what?   Jewish.   No.   What are you doing?   Reading your notes. They're encrypted. Please. Have some coffee. Okay. Then we're gonna have a very serious conversation... ...about what's yours and what's mine. It's amazing what you figured out with the parade photos. Thank you.   It's too bad you don't have hers.   Whose? Her. Can I...? Sorry. Yeah, all right. Close that. No. Not that. That's the one. Yep. Where the fuck's that? That's down there, isn't it? Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah. And... What does that say there?   "N" something "R S J."   That's "Norsjö," yeah. Then something "K." Something "R I F." "Carpentry." Well, we need to find a carpenter. Fuck! The carpentry shop is gone. I don't even know if he worked there or not... ...but if he did, maybe he used to come in here for hardware. I don't recognize him. Sorry. Well, I had to start somewhere. I'm no detective, but 1966, I would have started at a retirement home. This is Brännlund's kid. Do you know where I might find him? The son? Next to his father at the cemetery. He was killed in an accident on a construction site, years ago. But... ...she might still be alive. His widow. Do you know where I might find her? Please drive to highlighted route. In 1966, you were in Hedestad with your husband. Who took these? A local photographer. You were taking pictures too that day... ...and I'd love to look at them if by some miracle you have them. It wouldn't be a miracle. We were on our honeymoon. But why? This girl here. Here, you can see her better in the enlargement. See, that's you there. Just after this was taken... ...after she'd seen something across the street, she was murdered. How awful.   There you are.   Thank you. Would you mind if I made a copy of this? No. I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky. So call him. Next time, fill out the proper paperwork. Which one are you? Going down. How's your sex life? I didn't care much for your last report. It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it. Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's. Don't speak. I don't want to hear your voice, just nod. Start looking for a shrink you can bribe... ...to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me. And stop visiting tattoo removal websites. Or I'll do it again... ...right here.   Is that dental floss?   Yes. You're gonna sterilize that, right? Couldn't we just use tape or something? No. What? Thank you. Jesus!   Drink.   Okay. Just be careful. it's my eye.   Don't move.   You're not a doctor.   Take off your wet clothes.   What? Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, I think it's stopped bleeding. It still fucking hurts, though. Madness. I mean, madness. This is fucking madness. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay. Jesus, that hurts. Fuck. This is insane. I mean, these people... Somebody was shooting at me. I mean, it wasn't an accident. No one's shooting at you now. You know, I'm pretty sure this is a bad idea. Why? I'm old and we work together... You work with what's her name and that's worked out for you. Yeah, well, I do have some standards, believe it or not. You need to stop talking. Oh, shit. Do you want me to open a window?   I like working with you.   I like working with you too.   It could have been a stray shot.   Not by Gunnar. If he wanted to shoot him, he wouldn't be here. And then we have poachers. They shoot at anything that moves. Or he's right, Dirch. What if he is? This has to stop. Do you want to stop, Mikael? Look, I have police reports, photos... ...Henrik's notes, my notes, Lisbeth's research. What I don't have is Vanger industries' records.
That's what I want.
Why?
Will you authorize it?
What, the private corporate records?
Well, how far back?
Henrik said I could have access to everything.
This is what I need.
That's not what he meant.
I'll sign a nondisclosure statement.
Just a minute.
I think Henrik would say yes.
That's why he has me.
To protect him from himself.
it's insane.
What have we got to hide?
After 120 years of business, probably a lot.
If this is what he needs to finish, he should have permission.
What am I looking for?
Any connections between Vanger industries... ...
and the towns where the women were killed.
And everything about Frode.
Your father was taking pictures that day that no one has seen.
I'd like to take a look at them.
So ask him.
I was wondering if you could do that.
I don't speak to him.
Could you make an exception in my case?
Are you afraid to be in the same room with him?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be.
So you won't help me?
Sorry.
Please?
Are you finished?
I need to know where all factories... ...
offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966.   You already have everything.
No, I don't. Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships or suppliers.
You'll have to do without.
Mr. Frode said I have access... ...
to whatever I need.
I need this.
You have access to this floor.
Call him.
Thank you for seeing me.
Come in.
Tea?
Please.
Sven Olov Lindholm.
Me.
Handsome.
Birger Furugård.
Me.
Per Engdahl.
But your interest is in my more candid photographic work.
Friends, relations, that kind of thing.
Please.
"Blom" or "Bloom"?
Blomkvist.
I'm not a recluse.
I don't close my door to anybody.
Thank you.
They just don't visit.
Well... ...
perhaps if you redecorated.
Hide the past like they do?
Under a thin, shiny veneer?
Like an IKEA table?
I am the most honest of all of them.
The family?
Sweden.
Landscape?
Some nice landscapes there?
Who is this?
The blurry one.
I can't tell.
Oh, that's Gottfried's boy.
That's Martin.
Yeah.
Handsome but useless young man.
Like his father.
Like his father.
We're closing.
Nowhere near finished.
I'm not authorized to stay late.
I am.
And I need access to everything, including anything that's locked.
Call Frode.
Leave the keys with the guard.
Come on.
Shit!
Martin?
Mikael.
Hi there.
Your evening stroll?
Yes, that's right, I...
How are you?
Good.
I stopped by the hospital on my way home.
Henrik asked me to ask you something.
What was that?
Come on in.
I'll make you a drink.
Hello, Martin.
Shut the door.
it's quite windy.
What happened to you?
When?
Just now.
I fell in the dark.
You don't have a flashlight?
I'll get you one.
I just wasn't being careful, that's all.
How's the investigation going?
Nothing new to report.
No?
Dirch says the girl is really clever.
Maybe she'll turn something up.
Maybe.
Thank you for that.
So, what did he say?
What?
You said Henrik asked you to ask me something.
Well, I just did.
What?
How's the investigation?
Oh, yeah.
That was his question.
Do you hunt?
We should go hunting together sometime.
Sure.
Nothing at all new to report?
No. Nothing.
I can see you're anxious.
No. No, I mean to get home after the walk.
Yeah, well, I suppose I am.
To have dinner with your girlfriend.
Assistant.
We'll have better luck with a gun.
I'm sorry?
When we go hunting.
A gun.
Rather than a knife.
I want to show you something.
Bring your drink.
Leave my knife.
To the right.
Hi, leave a message.
I'll call...
You know what's harder than shooting someone?
Just missing him.
That was a very good shot up at the cabin.
It didn't work.
I'm here.
Mikael, it did work.
You're here.
Inside.
You spilled your drink.
Why didn't you just go home?
May I?
How did you do it?
What did you find?
We can talk or we can just get on with it.
I found a photograph... ...
no one has seen.
Of?
You.
In an Uppsala prep school blazer.
What does that prove?
You lied about where you were that day.
Did I?
Or rather, when.
So what?
People lie all the time.
It also says that you and Lena Andersson were schoolmates.
Lena...
That was a long time ago.
Where's this photo now?
Is it with all the other crap on your desk?
There's a copy on my laptop.
There's another copy... ...
on a secure website.
Secure website.
That's a lie.
How much does the girl know?
I hope it's as much as you do.
That'll make it fun.
Where is she?
Stockholm.
She went this morning.
That's a lie.
She's at our offices looking at more old crap.
I got a call from our archives manager.
She was very perturbed with this girl Lisbeth.
I like that name.
Lisbeth.
So when Lisbeth leaves, I will get a call from security... ...
so I can be at your cottage to greet her.
I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me.
Hey, hey.
So, what do you wanna know?
You're a journalist, ask me questions.
What do I do with the girls?
That's a good question.
Well, before, I do what we're doing: Sit down, relax, have a drink.
I like that part a lot.
Having a chat when both of you know that one of you is going to die.
And afterwards, I just get rid of them, far out at sea.
Unlike my father, who left them scattered... ...
all over the place, like trophies.
That's not very smart, if you ask me.
Well, he was a loud and garish man.
Frankly, he got what he deserved.
You can't be a sloppy technician like that.
You can't drink to excess like he did.
This takes discipline.
It's a science of a thousand details.
The planning, the execution.
It's the cleanup.
I guess I don't have to tell you... ...
but you're going to create quite a mess here.
Let me ask you something.
Why don't people trust their instincts?
They sense something is wrong... ...
someone is walking too close behind them.
You knew something was wrong.
But you came back into the house.
Did I force you?
Did I drag you in?
No. All I had to do was offer you a drink.
It's hard to believe that the fear of offending... ...
can be stronger than the fear of pain, but you know what?
it is.
And they always come willingly.
And then they sit there.
They know it's all over, just like you do.
But somehow, they still think they have a chance.
"Maybe if I say the right thing. Maybe if I'm polite. If I cry, if I beg." And when I see the hope draining from their face... ...
like it is from yours right now... ...
I can feel myself... ...
getting hard.
But, you know, we're not that different, you and I. We both have urges.
Satisfying mine... ...
requires more towels.
It might amuse you to know... ...
that while you were upstairs having moose with me and Liv... ...
who, by the way, finds me very conventional... ...
I had Irina down here in that cage.
Who is Irina, you might ask?
Just another girl.
Just another immigrant whore.
Who misses them?
Your sister wasn't. What?
Your sister Harriet wasn't just another girl.
You found her?
What happened to her?
You killed her.
You useless fucking detective.
This too tight to talk?
Good.
I'm tired of talking to you.
I've never had a man in here before.
In fact, I've never touched a man... ...
except my father.
That was our duty.
Harriet's and mine.
Hey.
There's a gun.
There's a gun on the television.
May I kill him?
Yeah.
How come a 23 year old... ...
is a ward of the state?
I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life.
Since when have they said that?
Since I was 12. What happened when you were 12? I'm sorry, that's none of my business.
I tried to kill my father.
Burned him alive.
Got about 80 percent of him.
I made some coffee.
Who's that?
Lt's Harriet.
I found it in Martin's basement among his souvenirs.
No, Martin didn't deny killing anyone.
But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused.
He got angry at me because I couldn't tell him what had happened to her.
He didn't kill her.
His father didn't do it.
He was dead the year before.
What if she did somehow manage to get away?
I mean, if... ...
she is still alive... ...
then there's only one person in this family who'd know where she is.
Fuck me.
Fuck me.
Fuck me.
Your turn.
Right.
Here.
Hi.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you.
What do you want?
Has no one called you?
About?
Your cousin Martin.
What about him?
He died in a car accident... ...
last Thursday.
There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad.
I'm not interested in any memorial.
Well, I understand.
What do you understand?
Well, that you don't care very much for your family.
Look, I just thought you should know.
Now I know.
How'd it go?
Okay, I think.
She's on.
And she's shopping.
She's still playing solitaire?
And she hasn't called anyone?
No. We have her cell phone too?
I was so sure she was gonna lead us to her.
Put your hand back in my shirt.
There's only one reason she hasn't called Harriet.
She can't. Because Harriet is dead.
I was just thinking that...
Just one second.
Okay.
What were you going to say?
I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility.
Well, we could, absolutely.
What is it now?
Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook... ...
Harriet.
So you sent the flowers.
Yes, I did.
We found in the Swedish Family Registry that Anita was married.
But the family never knew, did they?
No. So I'm guessing she then came here on her married name passport... ...
and you followed on her maiden name passport.
No, actually, it was the other way around.
She thought that it was safer if I traveled with Spencer myself.
Well, what did he think about that?
Nothing.
Only that he loved her.
She said, "if you love me, you'll do this and not ask why." And he never did.
And they both died 20 years ago.
Car accident.
You found that out too.
Ls that you?
I was 14 the first time he raped me.
Martin.
No, my father.
Martin only started after he had died.
Well, why didn't you tell somebody?
I did.
My mother.
Henrik would've done something.
I almost told him.
But I was afraid because of what I'd done.   L...
You still don't understand, do you?
A year after the first time... ...
and there were many times during that year... ...
my father got drunker than usual one night... ...
and he started bragging about the women he'd killed.
He quoted from the Bible as he tore my clothes off.
He tied a belt around my neck.
He wanted to kill me.
I got out of the house.
I went down to the dock.
He came staggering after me.
I could never fight him off in a small space... ...
but out in the open... ...
I was strong enough to deal with an old drunk.
When it was over... ...
I looked up and Martin was standing there, staring at me.
And all I'd accomplished was substitute one for another.
A couple of months later, Henrik sent Martin to school in Uppsala.
And I thought that maybe, just maybe, the nightmare was finally over.
And then I saw him the day of the parade... ...
across the street.
And I knew that it would never be over.
So how did you escape?
Anita.
She...
She insisted that I leave everything behind.
If I took anything the police might have suspected that I was still alive.
As everyone ate dinner, I was no more than 20 meters away from them.
I spent the night there.
That's when the search started.
In the morning, she came to get me.
I'd grown up with that bridge as my link to home... ...
but all I could think is... ...
if I could just get away from them... ...
just get past the police... ...
then I might be safe.
And I was.
Until you showed up.
You're safe now.
How did you get away?
Someone saved me too.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
Thank you, Anna.
I made you a promise... ...
whether you found anything or not.
So, what do you have to tell me?
What's this?
Hello, Henrik.
I barely remember Wennerström working here, much less being fired.
How could you?
It was such a long time ago... ...
which is kind of more to the point than the money he embezzled from you.
You're referring to the statute of limitations... ...
but I had no idea this is what Henrik was holding out.
If I had, I never would've let him bring you up here.
He wasn't trying to deceive you.
He knows you can't try somebody 35 years after the event.
I like Henrik, but he knows that.
A man's reputation means something.
He believes that.
He thought you could destroy Wennerström... ...
in the court of public opinion.
The court of public opinion... ...
celebrates people's bad behavior.
He's an elderly man.
He promised me Wennerström's carcass on a plate.
This isn't even the plate.
I can't do anything with this.
Yes, of course.
What happened with Wennerström?
How did he get you?
I was stupid.
I heard something.
I got it from an anonymous source... ...
who I'm now sure was one of Wennerström's lackeys.
It was fake.
Which he easily proved in court.
You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life... ...
was illegal and immoral.
Would you feel the same about Wennerström?
Go on.
I did some work on my own on him... ...
before you hired me.
I haven't looked at it all... ...
because you and Harriet fucking Vanger... ...
have kept me busy.
But I may have something.
You may have something?
Maybe.
They launder money from arms and drug sales... ...
and crime syndicates in Russia.
And that money accounts for all but 5 percent of his holdings.
The rest ends up in accounts in the Cayman islands.
And how do you know this?
This time you don't want to know.
This time I do want to know.
I have access to his computer.
And his accountant's and lawyer's.   And how do you have that?
I could've gotten it from a source inside the company.
You didn't.   But that's what you'll say.
And what will you say to me?
Well, that depends if you really want to know.
I do.
Mikael, how did you get access?
Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist... ...
who, this time last year was convicted of libel... ...
in a Stockholm courtroom... ...
doesn't seem to have learned from his mistakes.
Or maybe he has.
In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges... ...
the company that sued him, the Wennerström Group...
The shit hits the fan. ...
Of criminal activities on a global scale.
What happens now?
Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta, which won't wash.
The police will investigate, Fl will investigate.
It'll go to court.
Maybe he'll go to prison.
You think?
Probably not.
These guys never do.
What's wrong with you?
It's embarrassing.
Tell me.
I need to borrow some money.
Fifty thousand.
I have a chance to make an investment.
It's a smart, safe investment.
I really don't think I've got 50,000.   Yes, you do.
You have 65,000 in your two accounts.
I'm sorry that I know that.
You'll get the money back, I promise.
Okay.
You want a coffee?
These allegations, like the last one from this so called journalist... ...
are as ridiculous as they are untrue.
I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again, and I'm looking forward to it.
What about his documentation?
Fabricated.
All of it.
The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. Wennerström of that.
If a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist alleges proves to be true... ...
not only will there be a securities investigation... ...
but an organized crime inquiry as well.
Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.
And we can't force him to.
But we can look for them.
Beginning where?
Those closest to Mr. Wennerström.
Only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this... ...
has access to this kind of information.
Mr. Wennerström isn't available for comment... ...
but I'm happy to answer questions.
Where is he?
At home, I imagine.
No, he's not.
Has he left the country?
I don't think so.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Welcome to the Dolder Grand, miss.
May I have your passport, please?
With his failure to appear... ...
before a Security Exchange Commission panel... ...
a warrant has been issued for the Wennerström Group CEO.
I can confirm that he left Sweden... ...
on a private jet that landed in Paris last week.
Whether he's still there, we don't know.
He can be anywhere by now.
Thank you.
I have accounts at Bank of Kroenenfeld, Cayman islands.
I'd like to transfer them and convert to bonds.
Naturally, you have the clearing codes.
Naturally.
How many accounts will you transfer?
Thirty.
This will take some time.
You will receive 4 percent commission.
I will.
Then it won't be a waste of it.
A Swedish tourist vacationing here in Barbados... ...
says he knows where fugitive financier Hans Erik Wennerström is: Here, in this Caribbean island's capital, Bridgetown.
Police released this photo and believe it is the disgraced billionaire.
How many of these would you like to convert for deposit?
All 50, into five accounts.
Yes.
That looks correct.
The man who is now being called Sweden's Charles Ponzi... ...
may no longer have a country to call home... ...
but does have enough money to buy one.
According to the International Banking Commission... ...
Wennerström, a week after the Millennium article appeared... ...
on newsstands, began emptying accounts... ...
at Bank of Kroenenfeld in the Cayman islands.
That money, approximately 2 billion euros... ...
was then spread over a number of accounts... ...
with the help of this confederate, seen here in Zurich.
Hey.
Hey.
The money I borrowed.
Already?
Thank you.
No, I quit.
It was a good investment?
It was okay.
What are you doing later?
I'm seeing my daughter.
Okay.
You look nice.
It's Christmas again.
I'll see you soon.
Mr. Wennerström won the libel case...
You got that call in the office.
I miss our meetings.
I'm sure you don't. Why would you?
I was always such a headache for you.
Never showing up with good news, only problems.
I have good news now.
I made a friend.
I mean, one that you'd approve of.
I'm happy.
A man who authorities here in Marbella have confirmed... ...
is fugitive Hans Erik Wennerström, shot three times in the head... ...
in what police are calling a classic gangland execution.
The investigation into Wennerström's ties... ...
to crime organizations worldwide will now turn into speculation.
Which of them caught up with him before Swedish authorities could?
Wennerström spent the last days of his flamboyant life...
it's nice.
Your father?
A friend.
Must be a very good friend.
We're late.
Fashionably late.
